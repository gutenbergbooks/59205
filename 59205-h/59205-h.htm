<h2 id="Introduction"><span class="smcap">Introduction</span></h2>

<p>There is a question sometimes put to scholars, a
doubt often latent in scholars’ minds—How was
it that Greek civilisation, with all its high ideals and
achievements, fell so easily before what seems at
first sight an altogether inferior culture? The
difficulty is not solved by a reference to military
resources or administrative skill, for moral strength is
the only thing that matters in history, and a nation
has never yet succeeded merely by pure intellect or
by brute force. The fact is—and it is as well to
state it plainly—that the Greek world perished from
one main cause, a low ideal of womanhood and a
degradation of women which found expression both
in literature and in social life. The position of
women and the position of slaves—for the two
classes went together—were the canker-spots which,
left unhealed, brought about the decay first of
Athens and then of Greece.</p>

<p>For many centuries in Ionia and Athens there
was an almost open state of sex-war. At Miletus a
woman never sat at table with her husband, for he
was the enemy with whom bread must not be broken;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
at Athens, while all the men went free, women were
kept as slaves, and a stranger in the harem might
be killed at sight. The sexes were sharply separated:
men and women had but few opportunities for
mutual esteem and affection, and domestic life—the
life of the home, the wife and the children—was
poisoned at its source.</p>

<p>The causes and results of this war, far worse than
any faction or civil strife, are lamentable enough:
its manifestations in ancient literature are perhaps
even more important, for it is hard to say how far
current opinions of feminine disabilities are not
unconsciously due to the long line of writers, Greek
and Latin, from Simonides of Amorgos, in the seventh
century before Christ, to Juvenal in the second
century of our era, who used all their powers of
rhetoric and literary skill to disparage and depreciate
womankind. In the whole deplorable business men
were in the wrong, and they therefore took the
aggressive. They applied to women the comforting
doctrine of Aristotle, that some people were slaves
because they were made by nature to be slaves:
women were men’s moral inferiors, and therefore it
was men’s duty to keep them down.</p>

<p>At Sparta certainly, and perhaps in North Greece,
women occupied a very different place. Spartan
women were regarded as free human beings, and the
relations between the sexes were inestimably better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
than at Athens. But Sparta, Thessaly, Macedonia,
have no direct representation in Greek literature;
we get their point of view only in the writings of
some Athenians, such as Plato and Xenophon, who
rebelled against the current institutions of their
state, and in the Alexandrian poets, Apollonius and
Theocritus, who, even in the midst of the luxurious
city, kept some of the freshness of their native hills.
Most of the great writers came from Ionia or from
Athens: the Ionians are nearly all misogynists, and
have succeeded in colouring many parts of the
Homeric poems with their perverse immorality:
the typical Athenian, and those foreigners who found
their ideal in Athens—Herodotus, Sophocles, Thucydides,
the Orators—usually treat women as a
negligible quantity.</p>

<p>Æschylus was an original thinker, and in this, as in
many ways, took a different view from most of his
countrymen. But it is not until we come to Euripides
that we get the woman’s side of the case
definitely stated. Euripides ventured to doubt
man’s infallibility: he put the doctrine of the nobility
of man, as he put the other doctrines of the nobility
of race and the nobility of war, to the touchstone
of a really critical intelligence, and he came to a
conclusion very different from that which is expressed
by the great majority of his predecessors.</p>

<p>Upon his own generation Euripides had a profound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
effect. Socrates, Aristophanes, Plato, and
Xenophon are all feminists in varying degrees, and
a fairly full statement of feminist doctrine may be
found in their works. But the idealist did not win
the day. It is true that women were never so degraded—in
European civilisation at least—after
Euripides’ time as they had been before; but his
teaching did not bear its full fruit. Aristotle—the
supreme type of the practical mind—threw all the
weight of his unexampled influence into the other
scale, and the Aristotelian view of the natural
inferiority of women prevailed: so that the poets
of Ionia, libertines and profligates as most of them
were, find their work completed by the philosopher
of Stagirus.</p>

<p>Greek is the source from which most Roman writers
drew their inspiration, and although the position of
the Roman matron, honoured as the mother of the
household, was infinitely higher than that of the
too-often childless Athenian wife, there is still an
undercurrent of misogyny which permeates Latin
literature, and finds its fullest expression in Juvenal.
All the venom of earlier writers is collected by the
satirist, who adds the bitterness of his own bile,
seasoned with the highly-coloured rhetoric which
the Romans loved, and finally, with infinite zest,
disgorges the mixture in the six hundred lines of the
Sixth Satire. But, even as Aristotle sums up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
final tendencies of Greek literature, so Juvenal
represents almost the last effort of the anti-feminist
school at Rome. The Christianity of the East and
the romance of the North were already beginning
to modify the grosser realism of the Mediterranean
world, and towards the end of the second century
the reaction came, when the Greek genius gave to
the world the last, and perhaps the most fruitful,
of all its gifts in literature—the romantic novel.
Longus, in the <cite>Daphnis and Chloe</cite>, strikes a new note,
and his hero is, perhaps, the first gentleman in matters
of the affections that we find in ancient literature.
The barbarian invasions soon came to devastate the
land, but Longus had sown the seed, and he is the
true father of all the love romances of mediæval
chivalry. As Nausicaa is the first, so Chloe is almost
the last of ancient heroines; and Greek literature,
by a curious turn of fate, ironical enough considering
its general tendency, ends as it begins, with the
praise of the perfect maiden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I"><span class="smcap">I.—The Early Epic</span></h2>

<p>Any discussion of Greek literature must begin with
Homer, although as regards women and the social
position the Epic in its first form stands somewhat
aloof from the general current of ancient thought.
The Homeric poems are in a very real sense the Greek
Bible, for they represent a standard of morality
which in many respects is far higher than that
which prevailed at Athens in the great era of Greek
history, and they picture a state of society very
different from the complex civilisation of the city-state.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the Homeric poems
were not written to suit the taste of the old Mediterranean
people, who, if we may trust the evidence
of archæology and certain signs in their language, had
but a low code of sexual morality, and were inclined
to regard women as mere instruments of pleasure.
The Epic, in its original shape, was composed for
the Achæan chiefs who came down into Greece from
Central Europe, and in sexual matters were rather
of the Scandinavian type. But the Achæans were
only a small ruling class, and were soon assimilated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
by the conquered peoples, whose language they
adopted. A second tide of invasion by the northern
tribes called Dorian led to somewhat more permanent
results, but the original Mediterranean race
was always far superior in numbers, and unless
inter-marriage was prohibited by law it was only a
matter of time for the primary racial type to reappear.
Hence the interest of Greek history, which is one
long process of inter-blending and change: the
renascence of the conquered and the gradual disappearance
of the conquerors. Hence also the
difference of view in all feminist matters
between Homer and much of the later Greek
literature.</p>

<p>The Odyssey especially, which, though perhaps
later in composition than the original Iliad, has been
less worked over and received fewer additions, is
based on an entirely different idea of woman’s
position from that which was held after the seventh
century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Samuel Butler’s theory that the
Odyssey was composed by a woman, perhaps
Nausicaa herself, is hardly capable of exact proof,
but at any rate women in the Odyssey are never
degraded as they are in many of the later passages
of the Iliad, and the one lewd passage, the first lay of
Demodocus (in Book 8), ‘the loves of Ares and
Aphrodite,’ is a plain interpolation, and a clumsy
one at that. Women indeed pull the strings in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Odyssey: the goddess Athena, the nymphs,
Calypso and Circe, and the mortals, Penelope and
Nausicaa, are the principal actors in the drama.
With both these latter there are traces of the old
German custom of Mutterrecht: the kingship of
the tribe seems to go on the woman’s side. The
claimants to Odysseus’ chieftainship seek it through
his wife; Nausicaa is the only daughter, and her
marriage is of importance to all the tribe. So Calypso
and Circe are represented as island-queens, living
in independent sovereignty, and normally unconcerned
with male companionship. Odysseus is
to both very much in the position of a prince consort,
and, being an active man, suffers severely from lack
of occupation and lack of power. Athena is the
guiding spirit of the whole action, and takes a
motherly interest in the hero, but otherwise she is
pure intelligence superior to man and quite free
from any desire for man’s society.</p>

<p>The women of the Odyssey follow her lead, and
have little trace of that over-sexuality which is
ascribed by later writers to all women as a natural
trait. It cannot be said that the wise Penelope
shows any womanish weakness in her constant love:
she bears her husband’s absence with resignation,
and maintains his authority intact during a period
of twenty years. On his return she is by no means
over-anxious to recognise him. When the nurse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
tells her of the slaughter of the suitors by Odysseus
she calls her a fool, and threatens her with punishment
for disturbing a busy woman with idle tales.
Telemachus chides her for her wilful stubbornness:
Odysseus dresses himself in royal raiment, but fails
to make any impression, and finally, in disgust,
calls to the nurse to make him up a bed so that he
may go off and sleep by himself, for, says he, this
woman has a heart of iron in her breast. When at
last she is convinced, she explains that her hesitation
has been due to a well-founded distrust of men and
their wiles, and she is content to let her husband go
off the very next morning to visit the old Laertes.</p>

<p>Again, Nausicaa has no traces of the timid shyness
which is counted a virtue among harem women.
She faces the half-naked Odysseus boldly, as he
comes from the bush where he has been hiding
‘like a lion of the hills, rained upon and buffeted
by the wind, and his eyes are ablaze,’ and in all her
dealings with him she is a charming mixture of
generosity and caution.</p>

<p>Moreover, the morality of the Odyssey in all sexual
matters is very high, and, if it is not offensive to
say so, it is women’s morality. There is very little
appeal to the sensual man, and although Calypso
and Circe were by later writers taken as types of
the voluptuous female, their fascination in the
Odyssey is left entirely to the imagination, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
are pictured as industrious housewives. The description
is the same for both—‘singing in a sweet
voice within doors as she walked to and fro before
the loom.’ Little or nothing is said of any physical
attraction they may have possessed.</p>

<p>So with the punishment meted out at the end of the
story to the maid-servants who had accepted the
embraces of the suitors. First, they carry out the
corpses of their dead lovers, then they wash and
cleanse the bloody floor, and finally they are hanged—twelve
of them together—‘like thrushes or doves
caught in a snare; and they struggled with their
feet for a little while, but not for long.’ It is one of
the few ruthless passages in the poem: there is no
tendency here to err on the side of indulgence to
the sins of the flesh, and for such sins harsher
measure is dealt out to the woman than to the man.</p>

<p>But as significant as anything of the gulf between
the Odyssey and later Greek literature is the treatment
of the two famous sisters, Helen and
Clytemnestra.</p>

<p>Helen, to the later Greeks the type of the wanton,
appears in the Odyssey as the faithful wife, respected
and self-respecting, of King Menelaus. She lives
in his palace, busy with domestic duties, and when
she thinks of the past it is to rejoice over her return
home and escape from Troy, ‘where,’ she says, ‘I
used to mourn over the cruel fate which Aphrodite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
sent upon me, when she led me from my beloved
country, leaving behind me my daughter, my home,
and my husband dear, who lacked nothing of perfection
in mind or in body.’ It is a very different
picture from that of Paris’ mistress, as we have
her in later stories, flying with a foreign youth from
her lawful lord, and betraying her too fond master.</p>

<p>So Clytemnestra—after the lyric poets of the
seventh and sixth centuries had worked up her
story—is that most dreadful figure to King Man, the
regicide, the woman who dares, by craft and guile,
to kill the man set over her as ruler. In all the later
stories it is Clytemnestra who arranges the details
of Agamemnon’s death—the bath, the enveloping
robe, and the axe; it is she who deals the fatal
blow, while her lover, Ægisthus, is a cowardly
nonentity, entirely under the dominion of the
woman.</p>

<p>But in the Odyssey the story is very different.
It is told twice—by Agamemnon to Odysseus in
Hades, and by Nestor to Telemachus at Pylos, and
this last version is significant enough to be given
word for word:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We Greeks (says Nestor) were lingering over there at
Troy, and many a task did we fulfil. But he—Ægisthus—at
his ease in the quiet valleys of Argos, where the
horses feed, tried to beguile the wife of Agamemnon
with soft words. At first, of course, fair Clytemnestra
refused to do the shameful thing, for she was a woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of honest heart. Moreover, there was with her a
minstrel, whom Agamemnon, when he went to Troy,
had bidden to protect his wife. But soon the fate of
heaven encompassed the minstrel, and brought him to
his death, for Ægisthus took him to a desert island and
left him there, a prey for the birds to tear asunder.
As for the queen—he willing and she willing—he led
her to his house. And many a sacrifice did he offer
to the gods when he had done that great deed, which
never in his heart had he expected to accomplish.</p>

</div>

<p>Such is the passage, and the last two sentences
are a literal translation of the lines which appear
thus in Pope’s version:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then virtue was no more: her guard away,</div>
<div class="verse">She fell, to lust a voluntary prey.</div>
<div class="verse">Even to the temple stalked the adulterous spouse</div>
<div class="verse">With impious thanks and mockery of vows.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For these are the dangers of poetical translation.</p>

<p>But more important than any single character or
episode is the general impression given by the whole
poem, and it may fairly be said that the entire
framework of the Odyssey presupposes a condition
of society in which women are regarded as not in
the least, <i lang="la">quâ</i> women, inferior to men.</p>

<p>In the Iliad things are different, and the poem,
as we have it now, gives us three distinct pictures
of women’s position in life. The original epic, the
‘Wrath of Achilles’ has hardly any place for women
at all. It is true that Achilles’ anger has for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
cause the woman Briseis; but Achilles is angry,
not at the loss of a woman whom he loves, but at
the loss of a piece of property which he knows
by experience to be of considerable value and
service. Briseis is a slave—a thing, not a person.
In the whole Iliad she is only mentioned ten times,
and nine times out of those ten she is merely catalogued
as an article of value, with the slave-dealer’s
epithet, ‘fair-cheeked,’ attached.</p>

<p>But this is hardly surprising. All the earlier
portions of the Iliad are primarily lays of battle.
They are anti-social, and woman has no part or lot
in them.</p>

<p>The Iliad however, is built up of many different
strata, and one stratum—by no means the least
important—was contributed by a poet who understood
and sympathised with women. In thought
and language he has many affinities with the author
of the Odyssey, and he is probably responsible for
the one passage in the poem where Briseis appears
as a human being, and makes lament over the dead
body of Patroclus: a speech which served Ovid
as the groundwork wherefrom—with many embellishments—he
expands the letter in ‘the Heroines.’
From the same hand as Briseis’ speech comes the
supreme scene of the parting between Hector and
Andromache, and all the closing passages of the
Iliad: the ransoming of Hector, and the lamentation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of the women—his wife, his mother, and Helen—over
the corpse.</p>

<p>No one can read the Iliad without feeling that the
moral spirit of all these passages is of a very different
and of a very much higher quality than the brutality
of the earliest lays, and the loose cynicism of the
last additions to the poem, which we shall have next
to consider.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II"><span class="smcap">II.—The Ionians and Hesiod</span></h2>

<p>Between the Homeric poems in their first shape
and the next stage of Greek literature there is a
gap of centuries, and when the curtain goes up again
on Greek history at the end of the eighth century,
the centre of civilisation is in Asia Minor, the coast
towns and their adjacent islands.</p>

<p>The period of fighting, invasions, and tribal migrations
is over: there has been a revival of the old
Minoan culture, the Greeks have become a nation of
traders living in luxurious cities, such as Miletus and
Mytilene. Politically they are dependent on the
great Eastern land empires, and from the East
they have taken ideas which vitally affect the
position of women.</p>

<p>The first of these may be stated thus: a woman,
even a free-born woman, is the property of the man
who is her husband. The second, which follows
from this, is that, love between man and his property
being absurd, romantic affection is only conceivable
between men; between man and woman it is impossible.
Of these two ideas, the first, which involved
the seclusion of women and the harem system,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was only partially applied in ancient Greece. It
flourished in Ionia and at Athens during the great
period of her history, but it never took root in Sparta,
or in the chief cities of Hellenistic civilisation. Its
corollary, however, spread fatally from Asia to
Greece, and from Greece to Italy. It lasted for
many centuries, and tended to destroy all romantic
love between the two sexes, and very often all the
ordinary comfortable affection which may exist
without romance between husband and wife. The
sexes drew apart: the man, immersed in war and
politics and absent from his home most of his life,
had little experience of woman as a thinking animal,
and unfamiliarity bred contempt. As happened
again later in the world’s history under the very
different conditions of monastic life, the natural
social intercourse between men and women was
artificially hampered, and the inevitable crop of
errors and perversions followed. But the monks,
in their dislike of women, were at least ostensibly
inspired by a strict code of sexual morality: a good
deal of Ionian literature has for one of its objects
a desire to defend the perverted sexual instinct
which was the curse of ancient life. Of this sort
are the stories of Ganymede, the young Asiatic,
taken up to heaven by the ruler of the sky and
displacing the maiden Hebe, and of Hylas, the minion
of Heracles, whose beauty brought him to his death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Narcissus and Hyacinthus are persons of the same
type, while the heroes of this kind of literature,
Jason, Heracles, and Theseus, reserve all their
finer chivalrous feelings for men, and regard women
as a kind of booty, to be won, if possible, by fraud;
if fraud is ineffective, by the judicious use of force.
Jason deserts Medea in favour of a younger and
richer woman. Heracles leaves his wife, to roam
abroad, capturing by force any woman that pleases
him. Theseus spends his life in betraying women,
and in his old age marries Phædra, the young sister
of Ariadne. But their exploits do not at all detract
from the heroic character of the three worthies, for
it is now recognised that women are vile creatures
who deserve vile treatment, and so we have a second
class of tale invented to illustrate the innate viciousness
of the female sex. There is the story of Pasiphaë
and the Minotaur, Myrrha and Adonis, Leda and
the swan, Europa and the bull—and so on, and
so on.</p>

<p>The same frame of mind that invented these tales
ascribed to Sappho all kinds of unnatural vice,
degraded Helen into a wanton, and Penelope into
a shrew, and made it seem only logical that women,
being the creatures they were, should be kept
prisoners in a harem and confined to child-bearing—that
indispensable function being, indeed, the main
reason for their being allowed to exist at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The tales of Pasiphaë, Leda, and Europa, however,
though useful enough in their way, are a little crude,
and we have a more artistic method employed in the
passages which about this time were incorporated
into the Iliad by Ionian poets, with the idea of
degrading the whole conception of the two divinities
who represent womanly love, Hera and Aphrodite.
Hera, the goddess of married life, the wife in her
divine aspect, is represented by these decadents as
an interfering termagant, spying upon her
husband and seeking always to thwart him
in the enjoyment of his legitimate lusts and
caprices; Aphrodite, the goddess of unrestrained
physical passion, becomes a calculating
courtesan.</p>

<p>The method pursued is that same kind of false
realism which has supplied our comic stage with the
well-worn themes of the old maid and the mother-in-law,
and it need hardly be said that it harmonises
very badly with the romantic splendour of the epic
lays. The heroic hexameter gives for our ears an
air of nobility even to this stuff, but in its essence
it is colloquial style of a rather tawdry sort, and
one or two passages will illustrate its character;
for example, the last hundred lines of Book 1 of the
Iliad, an episode altogether out of harmony with
the rest of the book. Thetis has come to
ask Zeus to avenge her son: Hera knows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
her visit, and this is the language she uses to her
husband:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>You crafty one—you know it’s true; who of the gods,
pray, has been plotting with you again? You know
that is what you like, to get away from me and to
make up your mind without me, keeping your plans
secret: never yet have you had the decency to tell me
outright what you mean to do.</p>

</div>

<p>Her husband, being a male, is far more reasonable
in his tone: ‘You must not expect to know all my
business, my dear: it would be too hard for you,
you know, though you are my wife,’ and so on,
gently putting her in her inferior place. But Hera
refuses to listen to reason: ‘What do you mean by
that?’ she cries. ‘I have been only too ready in
the past not to ask questions, I have left you at
your ease, you have done what you liked,’ and she
proceeds to disclose her well-founded suspicions,
until Zeus, giving up any further appeals to her
better feelings, tells her bluntly to sit still and do
what she is told. If not, ‘All the gods in heaven,
you know, won’t be of any use to you when I come
close and lay my irresistible hands upon you.’ A
further edifying touch is given by the well-meant
intervention of Hera’s lame son, Hephaestus, and the
scene closes with the unquenchable laughter of the
blessed gods.</p>

<p>Another similar episode is the passage in Book 14,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
known as ‘the beguiling of Zeus,’ or, as we might
say, ‘the tricked husband.’ Hera, it begins, saw
her husband sitting on Mount Ida, and abhorred
the sight of him. The story can be condensed by
omitting all the ornamental epithets and turns of
phrase which are used to give a very un-epic passage
an epic colouring, and it runs somewhat like this.</p>

<p>Though she detests her lord, she still has to consider
how to get the better of him, and she decides to
dress herself in her finest. She goes accordingly to
her bower, with its close-shut doors and its secret
key, fastens the bolt, and begins an elaborate toilet.
It is a sure sign of the odalisque that perfumes,
jewellery, adornment of every kind are lavished
upon her by the very men who really regard her as
a chattel, and the whole description that follows reads
like a passage in the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, themselves
probably a product of the same kind of Greek
genius as composed these portions of the Iliad.
Every detail is lovingly dwelt upon; first with
‘ambrosia’ (the author hardly troubles himself
about what ambrosia really is, and uses it as a sort
of trade word), she washes her lovely skin, and then
she anoints herself with oil, an ‘extra-ambrosial’
sort, which has been specially perfumed for her:
then she combs her hair and twists it into bright,
beautiful, ‘ambrosial’ curls. Next comes the ‘ambrosial’
robe with dainty patterns upon it, pinned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
across the chest by golden brooches, and the corset
belt with its hundred tassels, and finally the earrings
shining brightly with their three pendants. The
goddess is now ready, except for the last two articles
of a Greek lady’s toilette, the yashmak veil and the
sandals, and as she is going abroad she puts them on
and calls upon Aphrodite. Being a woman, she
begins with a circumlocution. ‘Dear child,’ she
says, ‘I wonder whether you will say yes or no to
what I have to ask.’ Aphrodite invites her to be
a little more plain, and ‘the crafty’ Hera then
enters into an elaborate and entirely false explanation.
She wants to borrow the magic cestus of
Aphrodite in order to reconcile Oceanus and mother
Tethys, a pair whose matrimonial affairs have been
going so badly that they are now occupying separate
rooms. ‘If I could only get them together,’ she
says, ‘they would ever afterwards call me their
friend.’</p>

<p>Whether Aphrodite believes the story or not is
best left unsaid, but she at once consents: ‘It is
not possible or proper to refuse you, for you sleep
in the arms of the mighty Zeus,’ and she hands her
the cestus with all its magic powers—‘in it are love
and desire and sweet dalliance and alluring words,
which rob even the wise of their wits’—then with
mutual smiles they separate.</p>

<p>All through the passage it will be noticed there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a good deal of talk about magic, the same sort of
magic as we get in the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, but the effect
of the cestus is really quite independent of any supernatural
aid. It was an article such as may be seen
to-day advertised in a fashion paper—a ‘soutiengorge’—and
it produced that development of the
female bust and general appearance of embonpoint,
which has always seemed to Eastern nations the
ideal of feminine beauty.</p>

<p>Binding the cestus then under her breast, Hera
goes off to pay her next visit, to the god Sleep, whom
she begs to send Zeus into a deep slumber. For
this service she promises the god ‘a beautiful golden
chair, something quite unbreakable, with a footstool
attached.’ But Sleep raises difficulties. He has
tried a similar trick on Zeus before at the lady’s
request, and when the god awoke he was very violent,
and Sleep would have been thrown out of heaven
into the sea had not mother Night interfered to save
him. In fine, a chair, even a golden chair, is not a
sufficient reward for such a dangerous task. Hera
accordingly raises her offer from a chair to a woman,
and promises him one of the younger Graces as his
bed-fellow. Sleep at this agrees to help, the pair go
to Mount Ida, Sleep changes himself into a bird to
watch the scene of beguiling, and Hera reveals
herself to Zeus.</p>

<p>As soon as the god sees her, he asks where she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
going, and she repeats again the story of Oceanus
and Tethys’ misadventures and her projected intervention.
But the god tells her brusquely, like a
real master of the harem, that he needs her presence
and that she can go there another day: then, as a
climax of good taste, he recites the long list of his
mistresses, beginning with Ixion’s wife and ending
with Leto. To this impassioned love-making, worthy
of Don Juan himself, Hera, ‘the crafty,’ replies at
first with an affectation of modesty, but the scene ends
with the god in her arms: her purpose is accomplished
and man once again is beguiled.</p>

<p>Dr. Leaf finds the passage full of ‘healthy sensuousness,’
but to other readers it may well seem
thoroughly unpleasant, both in its sentiment and
its language—for example, the horrible reiteration
of ΤΟΙ, ‘mon chéri,’ at the end of Hera’s speech of
invitation. Still, it is a valuable document. The
brutal god and the crafty goddess are plainly the
poet’s ideals of man and woman; and his ideals
are very low.</p>

<p>These two passages from the Iliad may serve as
specimens of the second method of attack, that of
sarcastic depreciation under the guise of realism, of
which we have some further examples in Hesiod.</p>

<p>The strange medley that now bears his name is
in the same position as the Iliad. There is much
ancient wisdom, in which woman has little part.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
‘Get first a house, and then a woman, and then a
ploughing ox,’ and there are also many passages
plainly inspired by the new Ionian spirit.</p>

<p>The few facts that we know of Hesiod’s life would
suggest that he was an Ionian poet who migrated to
Bœotia, and incorporated into his verse the ancient
lore of the country, much of it as old as anything
we have in Greek literature.</p>

<p>Hesiod’s father was a merchant who lived at
Kyme, on the coast of Asia Minor. The son passed
most of his life at Askra, but of his life we know little,
of his death a good deal. He had a friend, a citizen
of Miletus, who came to stay with him in Greece.
The two Ionians travelling together were entertained
by one Phegeus, a citizen of Locris. They repaid his
hospitality by seducing his daughter: the girl
committed suicide, and her brothers, taking the law
into their own hands, avenged her ruin by killing
both Hesiod and his friend, who indeed was said
to have been the chief culprit.</p>

<p>This tale, which is by far the best-authenticated
fact in Hesiod’s life, does not give us a very pleasant
impression as to the poet’s capacity for passing
judgment on women, and probably the details of the
Pandora myth are his own invention. The story
itself is very old, but, as told by Hesiod, it has all
the sham epic machinery, while it is linked on to
the ancient fable of Prometheus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>To revenge the gift of fire to men, Zeus resolves
to make a woman. ‘I will give them an evil thing,’
he says; ‘every man in his heart will rejoice therein
and hug his own misfortune.’ Accordingly,
Hephaestus mixes the paste and fashions the doll.
Athena gives her skill in weaving, Aphrodite ‘sheds
charm about her head and baleful desire and passion
that eats away the strength of men.’ Finally,
Hermes gives her ‘a dog’s shameless mind and
thieving ways.’ Then the doll is dressed with kirtle
and girdle, chains of gold are hung about her body,
spring flowers put upon her head, and she is sent
down to earth. ‘A sheer and hopeless delusion,
to be the bane of men who work for their bread.’</p>

<p>Epimetheus takes her to wife, and when he had
got her, ‘then and then only did he know the evil
thing he possessed.’ So the tale of Pandora ends,
and the story of the Jar, although it comes next in
the ‘Works and Days,’ is not certainly connected
with her history. It is ‘a woman,’ but not
necessarily Pandora, who takes the lid from the
Jar of Evil Things and lets them fly free over
the world, so that only one curse now remains
constant.</p>

<p>That curse, it will be remembered, is Elpis—not so
much Hope as the gambler’s belief in Luck. It is
the idea that things must change for the better if
you will only risk all your fortune: that the laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of the universe will be providentially altered for
your benefit; the belief, in fact, that so often makes
the elderly misogynist take a young wife.</p>

<p>Such is Hesiod’s attitude towards women, and with
Hesiod the first stage of Greek literature comes to
an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III"><span class="smcap">III.—The Lyric Poets</span></h2>

<p>Of the literature of the seventh and sixth centuries
before Christ, the lyric, iambic and elegiac poetry,
we have only inconsiderable fragments. There are
two reasons for the disappearance. In the case
of the greatest names, Alcæus and Sappho, the
Romans preferred the adaptations of Horace to
the originals. With most of the other poets, the
general standard of morality in their verse is so low
that they fell under the ban of the Early Church,
and as we know—unreasonably enough in her case—Sappho
was included with them, and her poems
publicly burnt. But in the fragments that we do
possess there appears unmistakably the same mixture
of sensual desire and cynical distaste for women which
disfigures the late Epic; until in this period it ends
in sheer misogyny.</p>

<p>In nothing is Aristotle’s great doctrine of the
golden mean more valuable than in matters of sex.
The sexual appetite is as natural as the appetites of
eating and drinking; and as necessary for that which
is nature’s sole concern, the preservation of the
species. If the sexual appetite is wholly starved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the result is as disastrous to the race as the total
deprivation of food and drink would be to the individual:
if it is unduly fostered, Nature revenges
herself in the same way as she does upon those who
exceed in the matter of food or drink, and abnormal
perversities of every kind begin. In sex matters the
normal man and woman alone should be considered—the
father and the mother of a family—and their
opinion alone is of any real value. But unfortunately
in literature, and especially in this Ionian literature,
the normal person is the exception, and most of the
writers we now have to consider seem to have been
unmarried and childless.</p>

<p>The paucity of material, probably no great loss
either in an artistic or a moral sense, has obscured
the facts, but there seems little doubt that in this
period literature was definitely used for the first
time to degrade the position of women. The iambic
metre was invented for the express purpose of
satirical calumny, and the three chief iambic poets
of the Alexandrian canon, Archilochus, Simonides,
and Hipponax, in their scanty fragments all agree
on one point: the chief object of their lampoons is—woman.
At the beginning of this period the two
sexes are fairly equal in their opportunities; at the
end the female is plainly the inferior. Sappho and
Erinna mark the turning-point in literature. Living
at a time when it had not been made impossible for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
women to write, they showed that a woman could
equal or surpass the male poets of her day. The few
fragments of Erinna’s verse that we possess, <i>e.g.</i>,
the epigram on the portrait of Agatharchis and
the pathetic elegy on the dead Baucis, reveal
a talent at least as fine and strong as that of
Alcæus; while of all the Greek lyrists, Sappho,
both in reputation and as far as we can judge
in actual achievement, holds by far the highest
place.</p>

<p>Later ages, indeed, found it difficult to believe that
Sappho was a woman at all. The scandal of male
gossip was inspired by a genuine and pathetic belief
that such a genius as hers must at least have been
touched with masculine vices. But in Sappho’s
writings, which are our only real evidence, there is
nothing distinctively ‘mannish’: she is neither gross
nor tedious. In the technique of her art, metrical
skill, the music of verse, she is at least the equal of
any poet who has lived since her day; in thought
and diction she is far superior to all her
contemporaries.</p>

<p>In dealing with the Ionian poetry, exact dates are
impossible, but the lyric age extends roughly from
the middle of the seventh to the middle of the
sixth century. The earliest writer in order of time,
and in some ways the most important, is Archilochus,
the Burns or Villon of Greece—outlaw, soldier of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
fortune, poet, the first man to introduce his own
personal feelings into literature.</p>

<p>Archilochus has his own special reasons for hating
women—‘Archilochum proprio rabies armavit iambo’—and,
as he says, he had learned the great lesson,
‘If anyone hurts you, hurt her in return.’ Betrothed
to Cleobule, the daughter of a wealthy
citizen of Paros, he found his marriage forbidden
by the lady’s father, Lycambes. The father’s
reasons may be guessed, even from the few
fragments of Archilochus that still remain.
But the poet turned abruptly from amorist
to misogynist, and spent the rest of his life in
railing against his lost mistress and womankind in
general.</p>

<p>Both in love and war he is uncompromisingly
frank. He tells us how he threw away his shield
‘<i>beside the bush in battle: but deuce take the shield,
I will get another just as good, and at any rate I have
escaped from death</i>.’ His love poems are equally
free-spoken. It is the actual image of his mistress
that torments him when he cries, ‘<i>With myrtle
boughs and roses fair she used to delight herself</i>’; and
again, ‘<i>All her back and shoulders were covered by
the shadow of her hair</i>.’ But to his fierce spirit such
love brings little comfort: ‘<i>Wretch that I am, like
a dead man I lie, captive to desire, pierced with cruel
anguish through all my bones</i>’; and, ‘<i>The longing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
that takes the strength from a man’s limbs, it is that
which overcomes me now</i>.’</p>

<p>Soon his love turns to hate and loathing, and he
imputes to the woman the fault that is really his
own: ‘<i>I was wronged, I have sinned. Aye! and
many another man, methinks, will fall like me to
ruin</i>.’ His mistress now for him has lost her beauty.
<i>‘No longer does your soft flesh bloom fair; even as dry
leaves it begins to wither.’</i> Like all women, she is
false and full of guile: ‘<i>In one hand she carries
water, in the other the fire of craft</i>.’ To marry a
woman now is, ‘<i>To take to one’s house manifest ruin</i>.’</p>

<p>The folly of men and the falsity of women seem to
have been the themes of the animal stories which
Archilochus, like Æsop, composed. Woman is the
fox; man is now the eagle, now the ape; but the
fragments are too short for a certain judgment.
What remains, indeed, of Archilochus is always
tantalising in its incompleteness. Of his epigrams,
for example, only three are left; here is a free
translation of one of them: ‘Miss High-and-mighty,
as soon as she became a wedded wife, kicked her
bonnet over the moon.’</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, we have preserved for us in
Herodotus a much longer specimen of Archilochus’
manner—a real Milesian tale, the story of Gyges and
Candaules. The tale is handed down to us in
Herodotus’ prose, and it is impossible to disentangle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the shares contributed by the Ionian poet and the
Ionian historian; nor is it necessary; the story is
typical of both.</p>

<p>Candaules makes the initial mistake of being
enamoured of his own wife, and the second mistake
of not believing Gyges when he is enlightened on the
subject of female modesty. His folly naturally
brings him to a bad end.</p>

<p>The story is interesting, but it is especially significant
when we compare it with the tale of the same
Gyges as told by Plato. There the sensual elements
disappear, the interest centres in the magic ring,
and the seduction of the queen and murder of the
king form merely the hasty conclusion of the narrative.
The difference between the two stories is the
measure of the difference between the feminist
philosopher and the libertine turned woman-hater.</p>

<p>But Archilochus at least has once loved a woman.
Our next poet, Simonides of Amorgos, seems to
have been a misogynist from birth. His work
now only exists in fragments, but it is so significant
of a frame of mind that the two longest passages
that survive deserve a verbatim translation. The
first runs thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Women, they are the greatest evil that God ever
created. Even if they do appear to be useful at times,
they usually turn out a curse to their owners. A man
who lives with a wife never gets through a whole day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
without trouble, and it is no easy matter for him to
drive away from his house that fiend abhorred, the foul
fiend, Hunger. Moreover, just when a man is thinking
to be merry at home—by God’s grace or man’s service—the
woman always finds some ground of fault and
puts on her armour for battle. Where there is a wife,
you can never entertain a guest without fear of trouble.
Again, the woman who seems to be most virtuous,
mind you, may well be the most mischievous of all.
Her husband gapes at her in admiration, but his neighbours
laugh to see him, and the mistake he is making.</p>

<p>Every one will praise his own wife—men are shrewd
enough for that—and then will talk scandal about his
neighbour’s, and all the time we do not realise that we
are all in the same plight, for, as we said before, this is
the greatest evil that God ever created.</p>

</div>

<p>The other fragment, the catalogue of women, is
longer and better known. It begins:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>From the first God made women’s characters different.
Into one kind of woman He put the mind of a pig, lank
and bristly, and in her house everything lies about
in disorder, bedraggled with mud and rolling on the
floor, while she herself, unwashed, in dirty clothes sits
in the mire and waxes fat.</p>

<p>The second woman God made out of a mischievous
fox. She is cunning in all things alike; she knows
everything, all that is bad and all that is good; often
her speech is fair, but often it is evil, and her mood
changes every day.</p>

<p>The third sort of woman was made out of a dog, and
she is the true child of her mother, ever restless. She
wants to hear and know about everything; she is always
peering about and roaming around, growling even
though there is no one in sight. A man cannot stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
her with threats; no, not even if in sudden anger he
break her teeth with a stone. Soft talk is useless,
too; it is all the same even if she happen to be sitting
among strangers: a man finds her a continual and hopeless
nuisance.</p>

<p>The fourth woman the gods in heaven made out of
mud—or rather they half made her—and then gave
her to man. Such a one knows nothing, good or bad;
the only business she has sense enough for is eating.
Even if God sends a bitter winter’s day and she be
shivering, she never will draw her chair closer to the
fire.</p>

<p>The fifth woman was made out of the sea, and she
has two minds within her. One day she is all smiles
and gladness. A stranger seeing her in the house will
praise her. ‘In all the world,’ says he, ‘there is not
a better or a fairer lady.’ But another day she is
insupportable to look at or to approach. She is filled
with fury, like a bitch guarding her cubs: savage to
all alike, friends and foes, detestable. Even so the
sea often stands quiet and harmless, a joy to sailors
in the summer tide, and often again is driven to madness
by the thunderous waves. It is to the sea that such a
woman is most like.</p>

<p>The sixth woman was made from an ass, grey of hide
and stubborn against blows. Though you use reproaches
and force, it is with difficulty you get her to
give way to you and do her work satisfactorily. She is
always eating, day and night; she eats in her bedroom,
she eats by the fireside. But if a man approaches
to make love to her, she comes forward quickly enough
to welcome him.</p>

<p>The seventh was made out of a polecat, a plaguy and
a grievous kind. There is nothing fair or lovable in
her, nothing pleasant, nothing charming, and any man
who comes near she fills with nausea. She is a thief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and annoys her neighbours, and often she gobbles
up the sacrifice herself without offering any to the
gods.</p>

<p>The eighth woman was the daughter of a mare, stepping
daintily with flowing mane. She shudders at the
thought of any servant’s work or labour. She will
never lay her hand to the millstone, nor lift up the
sieve, nor throw the dung out of doors: she won’t
even sit near the kitchen stove, because she is afraid of
the soot, and she makes her husband well acquainted
with adversity. Every day, two or three times, she
washes every speck of dirt off her, and anoints herself
with unguents. Her hair is always luxuriant and well
combed, with garlands of flowers upon it. Of course,
such a woman is a fine sight for the men to see, but she
is a curse to her owner, unless indeed he be a tyrant
or sceptred king who has a fancy to pride himself on
such delights.</p>

<p>The ninth woman came from a monkey: this sort is,
indeed, pre-eminently the very greatest curse that God
ever sent to men. Her features are shamefully ugly;
such a woman, as she walks through a town, is a mockery
to all men. She has a short neck, and moves with
difficulty; she has no buttocks, her legs are all bone.
Alas for the poor wretch who holds such an evil thing
in his arms! But as for guile and tricks, she knows
them all, and like a monkey she does not mind being
laughed at. She never renders anyone a service,
but all day long this is what she is seeking and looking
for—how to do some one as much harm as she can.</p>

<p>The tenth woman was made out of a bee: happy the
man who gets her! On her alone no breath of scandal
lights, but she brings a life of happiness and prosperity.
Husband and wife grow old together in love, and fair
and glorious are her children. Famous among all
women is she, and a grace divine encompasses her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
about. She takes no delight in sitting with other women
when they are telling bawdy tales.</p>

<p>Such women as she are the best and wisest given by
God to men: all the other kinds are a bane to men, and
by God’s decree a bane they always will be.</p>

</div>

<p>And so the fragment ends.</p>

<p>All this is pure misogyny; but it is interesting to
notice the especial faults which our poet imputes
to womankind. They are chiefly the two vices which
a surly master will always find in his servants,
gluttony and idleness; they work too little and eat
too much. We are far removed in this world from
our ‘Feed the brute,’ and it must be remembered
that in a Greek household the work was hard, monotonous,
and continual. There were no labour-saving
appliances, for the hard work was chiefly done by
women. Every mouthful of bread or porridge
eaten in a Greek home had come into the house
as a sack of dirty grain. First it was winnowed, and
cleaned by hand; then the grain was put into a
small hand-mill, and by a laborious process of pestle
and mortar it was ground into flour; the flour was
then made into dough, kneaded and baked; every
process being attended with the maximum of manual
labour and general inconvenience, borne by the
women of the house, while the master strolled about
the city.</p>

<p>So also with the clothes and household fabrics:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
every operation in their manufacture was done at
home by the women. The master contented himself
with buying the sheep-skins—and, as Theocritus
lets us see, often did that very badly—which he then
handed to his wife. First, the skins had to be washed
and dried; then the wool was cut off and carded;
then by a laborious process of spinning the wool
was turned into yarn, and finally on a hand-loom the
yarn was woven into cloth: the same piece of stuff,
so excellent was the workmanship, often serving for
coat, blanket and shroud.</p>

<p>It is obvious, then, that an idle wife—if such a
thing existed—or a wife who ate more than her
share of the laboriously prepared bread, would be
a great grief to her lord and master, who was himself
too busy with the higher work of politics to attend
to such things, and that the machinery of the household
would be put very much out of gear. It may
well be that Simonides was unfortunate in his choice
of a helpmate, for as Hipponax, the third of this company,
mournfully complains, ‘<i>It is hard to get a wife
who will both bring you a good dowry and then do all
the work</i>.’ Hipponax, if we may judge him by some
forty short fragments, was a thoroughly disagreeable
person; he is always asking and being refused; he
varies complaints with abuse or downright threats.</p>

<p>‘<i>Hold my coat</i>,’ he cries, ‘<i>and I will knock out his eye.
I’ve got two right hands, and I never miss when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
throw</i>.’ On the subject of women he does not say
so much as the other two, for the range of his thought
is almost confined to carnal delights. A fair sample
of his style is this fragment: ‘<i>There are only two days
in your life that your wife gives you pleasure: the day
you marry her and the day you bury her</i>.’</p>

<p>This insistence on the physical side of love runs
through all the elegiac and lyric poetry of the age.
Love to Mimnermus is a thing of secret kisses, of
chambering and wantonness, and it depends alone
on physical attractions. A young man is happy, for
he is handsome and desirable; an old man is
wretched, to women an object of scorn. The satiety
that comes from excess of sensual pleasure is the
main cause of the melancholy pessimism that broods
over much of Ionian literature. Of Alcæus and his
Lycus, Anacreon and his Bathyllus, Theognis and
Cyrnus, it is unnecessary now to speak, but it is
difficult to believe such amiable apologists as Mr.
Benecke when they try to show that a fine idealism
was the inspiration of these relationships. Neither
the character of the men’s writings nor that of their
time and country give much ground for such confidence,
and if we seek the purity of love’s passion
we must turn to Sappho.</p>

<p>Among all the foulness of her time Sappho shines
out like a star. No loss in literature is so lamentable
as the loss of the nine books of her poems that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Alexandrian library possessed; no treasure in literature
is quite so precious as the fragments that various
chances have preserved for us. And, luckily, the
number of those fragments is still increasing, as will
be seen by a comparison of the two best studies
of Sappho in recent years, the exquisite collection
of translations issued by Mr. Wharton in 1886,
and the brilliant monograph on the new fragments
by Mr. J. M. Edmonds in 1912. Even since that
date fresh poems have come to light, and we do
not know what Egypt may have yet in store.</p>

<p>In all the fragments, new or old, there is an indefinable
quality of personal feeling. Sappho, it has
been said, has left us only a fragment of her work,
but it is a fragment of her soul. Her friend and rival,
Alcæus, is a great poet, but he lacks the fiery intensity
of her inspiration, which gives life even to the
briefest phrase that some grammarian has quoted for
a rare word. Take the lines that Rossetti adapted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Like the sweet apple which reddens upon topmost bough,</div>
<div class="verse">A-top on the topmost twig—which the pluckers forget somehow,</div>
<div class="verse">Forget it not—nay, but got it not, for none could get it till now.</div>
<div class="verse">Like the wild hyacinth flower, which on the hills is found,</div>
<div class="verse">Which the passing feet of the shepherds for ever tear and wound,</div>
<div class="verse">Until the purple blossom is trodden into the ground.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Or, again, this other:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Dead, dead.—In death,</div>
<div class="verse">Below the ground, bereft of breath,</div>
<div class="verse">Silent, alone, the close-shut tomb enfoldeth thee.</div>
<div class="verse">To my songs thou wouldst not hearken, and songless shalt thou be;</div>
<div class="verse">Thou wouldst not love me here on earth,</div>
<div class="verse">In death thou shalt loveless be.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Edmonds, in his translations, has kept much of
the simple charm of the Greek:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I have a little daughter rare,</div>
<div class="verse">That’s like the golden flowers fair,</div>
<div class="verse">My Cleis.</div>
<div class="verse">I would not take all Lydia wide,</div>
<div class="verse">No, nor lovely Greece beside,</div>
<div class="verse">For Cleis.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And this, a portion of a new fragment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And often as her way she wanders,</div>
<div class="verse">And on gentle Attis ponders,</div>
<div class="verse">With sad longing love opprest,</div>
<div class="verse">Her heart devours her tender breast</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Till she cries, in pain,</div>
<div class="verse">‘Oh, come to me,’ for you and I</div>
<div class="verse">Know the burden of her cry,</div>
<div class="verse">Since Night, which hath the myriad ears,</div>
<div class="verse">Sends her word of what she hears</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Across the severing main.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This tender simplicity is the soul of Sappho, and
in her verse even a few words will suggest a picture:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Come to me, O Love:</div>
<div class="verse">O Love, the inheritor, enter in.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Everywhere is swept and garnished,</div>
<div class="verse">Everything is prepared.</div>
<div class="verse">The fire of my heart burns brightly,</div>
<div class="verse">All my body is food for thee,</div>
<div class="verse">And on my bosom thou shalt sleep the long night through.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>ἐπὶ δὲ στήθεος ἐννυχεύσεις. Surely no one save
Sappho has touched so closely the heart of love and
poetry.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV"><span class="smcap">IV.—The Milesian Tales</span></h2>

<p>The chief characteristic of Ionian literature is a
certain softness, a kind of laxity of morals corresponding
to a looseness of political organisation.
The Ionian man was a convinced believer in freedom—for
himself; but he was by no means a believer in
the discipline which alone makes freedom possible.
Both in sexual matters and in politics, his desire for
freedom and his desire for pleasure were constantly
at cross-purposes. He wished to be independent of
women; but he was not meant by nature to be a
monk, and he purchased his apparent freedom by
yielding to a sensuality far more degrading than
that of women’s love. He wished to be independent
of Persia; but he was not a born soldier, and he
finally bought a pretence of autonomy by the payment
of tribute to a Persian satrap, forfeiting his
manhood for the sake of peace.</p>

<p>The Ionians were, indeed, a strange medley of
qualities, and with them intellectual activity stood
in sharp contrast with moral and physical sloth.
They were essentially a race of city dwellers; for
them the charm of the country and of nature had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
little attraction, and their civilisation found its most
perfect expression during the seventh and sixth
centuries in the splendid luxury of such towns as
the Ionian Miletus, in Asia Minor, and the Achæan
Sybaris, in South Italy. The two cities were closely
connected by ties of trade and social intercourse,
and in both places material prosperity led quickly to
moral corruption, and voluptuousness became the
rule of life. Like Buenos Ayres to-day, Miletus and
Sybaris were trading ports founded in a new country,
and the rapid growth of riches discouraged the
manlier virtues. The mixture of races was a danger,
the climate favoured voluptuous pleasures, and the
bracing stimulus of war was, until too late, absent.
The moral and sexual degradation that resulted from
this unbridled pursuit of pleasure found its expression,
as we have seen, in literature. The tale of
Ganymede, the episode of the tricked husband
in the <cite>Iliad</cite>, and the catalogue of women in Simonides,
are fair samples of Ionian thought. No one of the
three has any moral value; indeed, a strict Puritan
would probably refuse to let them soil his lips; but
they are at least decent enough to be written down
in a literary form, and to pass muster, if they are
not too closely examined.</p>

<p>There was, however, another and even less creditable
class of story of which literary historians tell
us little, but which, probably, was first invented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
in such towns as Miletus and Sybaris in the seventh
and sixth centuries, during the time of their greatest
prosperity—the so-called Milesian Tales. Usually
circulating by word of mouth, they endured for
centuries, and occasionally make a furtive appearance
in history, but their significance in sexual morality
has not always been appreciated. In dealing with
them as literature we are confronted with a threefold
difficulty: firstly, many of the most typical specimens
of this style were never written down at all;
secondly, most of the stories that found a footing in
literature were blotted out by the righteous indignation
of Christian moralists; thirdly, in the case of
the few that do survive, it is neither possible nor
desirable to introduce them to a modern audience.
But, though they are the least estimable part of
our inheritance from ancient literature, their influence
on ancient morals was very great, and their tendency
was so definitely to ruin any reasonable conception
of sex relationships that they force themselves
into notice.</p>

<p>Though sometimes written in prose, their natural
medium was the iambic measure, invented by
Archilochus, and they were meant both for a male
and female audience. Iambus the jester, <i lang="fr">Pierrot</i>,
has his female counterpart in Iambë, <i lang="fr">Pierrette</i>, who
appears in the Homeric hymn to Demeter, and by
her capers forces the sad goddess to smile once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
more. This is, perhaps, the one justification of
the tales; in their more innocent form they were
intended to purge away that feeling of melancholy
of which, as the precursor of madness, the Greeks
were so much afraid, by exciting the emotion of
laughter; just as tragedy effects the same purpose
by exciting the emotions of pity and fear. But this
sort of humour in Athens and Ionia soon degenerated
into coarseness, and Iambë, her name now changed
to Baubo, as we see her in the ritual statuette, a
woman sitting on a pig, played a prominent and a
shameful part in the Eleusinian mysteries of Demeter.
The worship of the sorrowing mother—Mater
Dolorosa—was made the cloak for nameless obscenities,
and the influence of religion was added to that
of literature to degrade men’s conception of women.
These were the sort of verses and images to which
Aristotle alludes in the Seventh Book of the <cite>Politics</cite>;
and this is one of the reasons for Plato’s objection
to poetry; better no literature at all, he thinks,
than literature degraded to these ends.</p>

<p>The worst type of Milesian or Sybaritic tale was
definitely meant to stimulate the animal passions,
and owed little to any qualities of humour or imagination.
The sense of artistic fitness which the
Athenians always possessed kept this kind of
stories out of written literature during the great
period, and confined them to the gossip of the perfumers’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and barbers’ shops. But as soon as the
decadence began, these ‘Ionian poems,’ as Athenæus
calls them, became a recognised branch of letters,
and we hear of their chief practitioners, writers of
‘facetiæ,’ the ‘Hilarodoi,’ the ‘Simodoi,’ and the
‘Lysiodoi.’</p>

<p>Among the more notorious authors were Simus the
Magnesian, Alexander the Ætolian, Pyres the
Milesian, and Sotades of Maronea, who gives his
name to that whole class of licentious writings which
is represented in modern times by the sotadic satire
of Nicholas Chorier. Sotades, however, did not
confine himself to the comparatively safe pastime
of libelling women. He ventured to write lampoons
upon Ptolemy Philadelphus and his sister Arsinoe,
was caught on the island where he had taken refuge,
put into a jar with a leaden top, and drowned.</p>

<p>But the most famous, or infamous, of all the class
is Aristides, usually called, but on very little evidence,
‘of Miletus,’ who lived perhaps in the second century
before Christ. Of the man and his book we have
little direct knowledge, but he was translated into
Latin by Sisenna, the companion of Sulla in his
voluptuous debauchery, and copies of this version
were found by the Parthians in the tents of the
Roman officers after the battle of Carrhæ. Even
the Parthians, as Plutarch tells us, were disgusted
by Aristides, and Ovid tries to use him as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
shelter for himself against the charge of immoral
writing. The Roman poet who, though a libertine,
was at least free from some of the grosser vices
of his age, complains bitterly in his exile of the
difference in treatment meted out to Aristides and
himself. ‘<i>Aristides was not banished</i>,’ he cries,
‘<i>and yet he fathered all the scandalous stories of
Miletus: the authors amongst us who now put together
Sybaritic stories go unpunished</i>.’</p>

<p>Sybaritic and Milesian were the descriptive adjectives
used even in Ovid’s time for this kind of
writing, and we can trace its popularity and influence
in Rome. Quotations are obviously impossible,
and indeed the <i lang="fr">genre</i> does not depend on literary
grace. One author alone, Petronius, possesses
sufficient skill to make it tolerable, and the viler
portions of the ‘Satyricon’ are the most real examples
of the literature that was inspired by Miletus,
and by Milesian ideas of womankind. The natural
coarseness of the Roman mind gave this sort of
story a greater prominence than the Greeks ever
allowed, but it will probably be correct to trace its
first origin to the coast of Ionia in the seventh century
and especially to the metropolis of the Ionian States.</p>

<p>From the beginning at Miletus the relations
between men and women were notoriously bad, and,
as Herodotus tells us, they had some historical
justification. ‘The first settlers at Miletus,’ he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
‘having no wives of their own, killed the men and
seized the women of the country.’ On account of
this massacre, the women established the law and
imposed upon themselves an oath, which they handed
down to their daughters, to this effect:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>They should never eat at the same table with their
husbands, nor should any woman ever call her husband
by his name. For they had killed their fathers, their
husbands, and their sons, and after so doing had
forced them to become their wives.</p>

</div>

<p>This is the first incident in the history of Miletus,
an episode not unlike the story of the Lemnian
women, and it explains a great deal. In the chief
city of Ionia, enmity, not love, was the law between
husband and wife. Domestic life was poisoned,
and literature caught the infection. By action and
reaction the mischief spread, and it is impossible
for us now fully to estimate its extent. But we
cannot doubt the effect that Ionian literature had
in lowering men’s estimate of women, and thereby
degrading all their ideals of social life. The three
great curses of Greek civilisation—sexual perversion,
infanticide, and the harem system—all come into
prominence during the sixth century, and there is
good reason to believe that it was just at this time
that the natural increase of population was checked,
and the slow process of race suicide begun. If
Ionia was the cradle of Greek culture, as we know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
it, from Ionia also came the germs of that moral
disease which made a fatal counterpoise to the
intellectual supremacy of Greece.</p>

<p>In the worse type of Milesian Tale immorality takes
its most revolting form; but there was another and
more pleasing form of story, also invented in Ionia
about this time, which occasionally is called by the
same title, and is best known to us in the collection
of Æsop’s Fables. Æsop himself, the lame slave
who was made by tradition the fellow-servant of
the fair courtesan, Rhodopis, and so a contemporary
of Sappho, is hardly more a real person than Homer,
and his name was used as a convenient shelter for
two slightly different kinds of humorous story.
There were the well-known animal fables which
are common to the whole Mediterranean and
Asiatic world, and in Æsop find a Greek dress, and
beside them a sort of humorous anecdote, sometimes
trivial, sometimes coarse, but always strongly
realistic.</p>

<p>They were especially popular at Athens. ‘Tell
them a funny tale of Æsop, or of Sybaris,’ says the
old gentleman in Aristophanes’ ‘Wasps,’ ‘something
you heard at the club’; and later on in the
play, when Bdelycleon is intoxicated, we get two
specimens of the style. Like our Limericks, they
are in verse, with a catch refrain: ‘<i>A woman at
Sybaris once</i>,’ and ‘<i>Æsop one day</i>,’ and although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
they are not particularly humorous, it must be
remembered that they are the witticisms of a
drunken man. The first runs thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Æsop one night was going back from dinner, when a
bitch began to bark at him, a bold, drunken creature.
Thereupon said he: ‘Dear, dear! my good bitch, if
you were to sell that foul tongue of yours and buy some
flour, you would be more sensible.’</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The other is this:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A woman of Sybaris once broke a jug. The jug got
a friend to act as witness, and laid a claim for damages.
Thereupon the lady said: ‘By the virgin, if you would
but let the lawyers alone and buy some sticking-plaster
you would show more wisdom.’</p>

</div>

<p>The fables of Æsop are now a nursery classic, for,
like the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> and <cite>Gulliver’s Travels</cite>, they
have been turned by the kindly irony of time to
a use which their authors hardly contemplated.
But in their Milesian shape there was always an
underlying vein of satire, even in the animal stories.
The male animals, the eagle and the lion, are brave
and generous; the females, the fox and the weasel,
are cunning and treacherous.</p>

<p>Moreover, as we see in the Greek version of Babrius
and the Latin of Phædrus, separated though they
be from the original by a gap of centuries, there was
a great deal of matter in the Æsopian stories which
was plainly misogynistic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>As examples, we may take from Babrius, Fable 10:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A man fell in love with an ugly, dirty slave-girl, his
own property, and readily gave her all she asked.
She had her fill of gold: fine purple robes trailing at
her ankles, and soon she began to rival the mistress of
the house. ‘The goddess of love,’ thought she, ‘is
the cause of all this’ and she honoured her with votive
tapers, going every day to sacrifice and prayer with
supplications and requests. But at last the goddess
came in a dream while they were asleep, and appearing
to the slave-girl, she said, ‘Do not thank me, or suppose
that I have made you beautiful: I am angry with that
fellow there, and so he thinks you fair.’</p>

</div>

<p>Belief in women’s beauty, we see, is mere infatuation,
and so is belief in their truth, as No. 16 shows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A country nurse once threatened a whining child:
‘Stop, or I will throw you to the wolf.’ The wolf
heard the words, and supposing that the old dame was
speaking the truth, waited patiently for the meal which
he thought would soon be ready. It was not till
evening that the child fell asleep, and the wolf, who
had been waiting on slow hope, went off home very
hungry, his mouth really agape. ‘How is it you have
come home empty-handed?’ said his wife, who had
been keeping house. ‘It’s very unusual.’ But the
wolf replied: ‘What would you have? I have trusted
a woman.’</p>

</div>

<p>No. 32 is a curious reminiscence of Simonides:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Once upon a time a cat fell in love with a comely
man, and glorious Cypris, the mother of Desire, allowed
her to change her shape and take a woman’s body,
one so fair that all men desired her. The young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
saw her, fell captive in his turn and arranged to wed.
The marriage feast was just prepared when a mouse
ran by, and the bride, jumping down from the high
couch, rushed after it. So the banquet came to an end,
and Love, who had had a merry jest, departed too—for
even he could not fight against nature.</p>

</div>

<p>No. 22 is more outspoken:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Once upon a time a middle-aged man—not young,
but not yet old, his hair a mixture of black and white—feeling
that he still had leisure for love and merriment,
took two mistresses, one young, one old. Now the
young woman wanted to see in her lover a young man,
the old dame desired some one as old as herself. So,
every time, the girl plucked out any hairs that she could
find turning white, while the old lady did the same to
the black hairs, until young and old together at last
pulled out all the hair he had and left him bald.
<em>Moral</em>: Pitiable is the man who falls into the hands
of women: they bite and bite until they strip him to
the bone.</p>

</div>

<p>So in the fable of the lion who falls in love with a
maiden, the noble animal strips himself of claws and
teeth, and everything that makes him formidable,
to please the girl, and for his reward is beaten to
death.</p>

<p>In all these stories there is a note of satirical
depreciation, but the best example of the cynical
humour which inspires the whole class is to be found
in the tale of the Ephesian Widow. Phædrus gives
a brief version; in Petronius the story is put into
the mouth of the satyr-poet Eumolpus, and in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
condensed form it will perhaps bear quotation.
‘There was once a matron of Ephesus so notoriously
virtuous that all the women of the neighbouring
towns used to come and gaze upon her as at a
wonderful spectacle.’ So it begins, and the first
sentence, which might come from Voltaire’s <cite>Candide</cite>,
gives the spirit in which it is written. The lady’s
husband died, and not satisfied with the ordinary
signs of grief, the bereaved wife insisted on following
the corpse to the underground chamber where it
was laid. There the lady ‘with singular and
exemplary constancy,’ remained with it for five
days, deaf to the entreaties of relatives and magistrates,
refusing all food, and attended only by one
servant-girl whose business it was to share her
mistress’ grief and renew the taper which alone lit
up the sepulchral chamber.</p>

<p>‘The whole country was full of the story,’ so
the tale runs, ‘and men of every class agreed that
this was a real and brilliant example of virtue and
affection in a woman—<em>the only one they had ever
known</em>.’</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, some robbers had been
crucified near the place, and a soldier on guard
over the crosses noticed the light of the taper gleaming
in the darkness. Yielding to the weakness of
human nature, he made his way down to the vault,
and was surprised to find a pretty woman, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
he had expected to see a ghost. But he soon
realised the situation—that the lady could not get
over the loss of her man—and so he brought his
traps down to the cellar and began to address some
words of comfort to her. ‘Do not persist in useless
grief,’ said he, ‘do not rend your breast with unavailing
sobs; all of us will come to this; we all
have but one final resting-place.’ His attempt at
consolation—which, though well-meant, is certainly
somewhat commonplace—only irritated the lady,
and he turned his attention to the servant (for in
this sort of stories there is always a soubrette) and
induced her to partake of his rations.</p>

<p>The girl was then able to persuade her mistress to
follow her example, and soon all three were eating
and drinking together.</p>

<p>‘You know,’ so says Eumolpus, ‘the result of
a good meal: the soldier was soon as successful in
overcoming the matron’s resolute virtue as he had
been in overcoming her resolute desire for death.’</p>

<p>The doors of the vault were closed, so that it might
appear that the good lady had breathed her last over
her husband’s body; the soldier brought down all
sorts of comestibles, and two or three days and
nights were spent in dalliance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the crucified robbers were quite forgotten,
and on the third morning the soldier found
that one of the crosses was empty, for the body had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
been removed for burial by the relatives in the night.
He explained his plight to the lady, and announced
his intention of committing suicide, the proper
penalty, as he said, for his neglect of duty.</p>

<p>But the matron was as compassionate as she was
virtuous, and ‘Heaven forfend!’ she cried. ‘I
cannot bear to see two such dear men both depart
from life. I would rather pay over the dead than
lose the living.’ So she told the soldier to take the
husband’s body out of its receptacle and fix it on the
vacant cross. ‘The soldier gladly followed the
clever lady’s ingenious idea, and the next day
people were wondering how it was that a dead man
had found his way to the cross.’</p>

<p>The Ephesian Widow represents the Milesian Tales
at their best; at their worst they are only to be read
by those who can touch pitch and not be defiled.
In themselves they are beneath contempt, but they
have a very considerable importance in the history
of the world, and especially in the history of the
relations of the sexes. The perverse ideas that underlie
them were transplanted from Ionia to Athens,
and, recommended by the literary genius of Athenian
writers, they have had an influence on later thought
which the Ionian pornographers would never have
secured.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V"><span class="smcap">V.—Athens in the Fifth Century</span></h2>

<p>We have traced the main tendencies of Ionian
thought, and have seen how the degradation of
women involved a corresponding degradation of
literature. Its very offensiveness protects a great
deal of Ionian work from notice, but it has been
necessary to quote some of the less noisome specimens,
for it must be remembered that this immorality
of literature was both the cause and the result of
the low opinion in which women were held. The
motives which inspired the whole school of writers
were utterly contemptible, the means they employed
were not much better; but they were successful
in their purpose. When Athens took over the leadership
of Greece, she took over from Ionia the idea of
women as inferior creatures, and during all the
great period of Athenian history women were a
subject class. It became no longer necessary to
slander them; they were simply neglected.</p>

<p>A woman’s life at Athens in the fifth century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>
was a dreary business. She was confined closely
to the house, a harem prisoner, but without any of
that luxurious ease which the harem system has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sometimes offered as a solace for the loss of freedom.
An Athenian house was small, dark, and uncomfortable,
and a woman’s day was occupied with a long
round of monotonous work. Occasionally she was
allowed out of prison to walk in some sacred procession,
as we see the quiet line of girls marshalled
on the Parthenon frieze, but all the amusements of
the town were closed against her. From the school
and the gymnasium, from the Odeon and the
Academy, from public meetings and from private
banquets, women were jealously debarred. It is
doubtful whether they were permitted even to enter
the theatre of Dionysus; and their shopping quarter,
where they bought their rouge and white lead, was
in the most remote and inaccessible part of the city.</p>

<p>The whole structure of social life was arranged to
suit men and to exclude women. It is true that the
patron divinity of the state was a woman, Athena,
but the goddess was divested of feminine attributes.
She became the ideal Athens, a conception as far
remote from an anthropomorphic divinity as any
race has ever possessed.</p>

<p>The stages by which women were reduced to this
condition of inferiority are, in the general obscurity
of early Athenian history, quite unknown; but there
can be little doubt that the whole position was due
to Ionian influence. The legal status of women,
especially in relation to property, seems to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
changed by definite enactment about the end of the
sixth century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, and in the <cite>Suppliant Maidens</cite> of
Æschylus there are traces of the conflict of principles
on which the change was based. Henceforward, in
the eyes of the Athenian law, a woman was merely
an appanage of any property which she chanced
to inherit, and her nearest male relative had to take
charge of her person—a <i>damnosa hereditas</i> for which
the material advantages of her estate served as
compensation.</p>

<p>Moreover, women in Athens were married far too
young, for the average age was about fifteen, and the
result of these early marriages was that by the time
a woman had arrived at years of discretion and might
have been an intellectual companion for her husband,
her beauty too often was gone and she herself was
worn out, a premature old woman. For girls no
education was considered necessary, and throughout
their childhood they were kept in constant seclusion.
They were regarded only as potential bearers of
children, and the most extreme precautions known
to modern eugenics were apparently practised before
marriage. But even as mothers they were not very
efficient, for their physique suffered from the narrowness
of their lives, and the wet-nurse—Titthe—was
to be found in most families. Just as the Breton
and Norman girls migrate to Paris, so those Athenian
households that could afford the expense would hire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the robust women of Sparta to take the mother’s
place. Alcibiades, for example, was suckled by a
Lacedæmonian nurse, and was not altogether an
alien when, exiled from Athens, he took refuge in
the Peloponnese. It was not in Athens, but at
Sparta, or in the islands where girls wrestled and
raced with young men, that Paionios found the model
for his ‘Victory’ with her flying feet, deep bosom,
and firm, rounded limbs; and in Aristophanes,
when Lysistrata assembles the women of Greece,
the Athenians can scarcely refrain their half-envious
admiration of the buxom vigour of the Spartan
Lampeto.</p>

<p>At Athens the restriction of women to one function
meant that even that one function was badly performed,
and all through the great period the Athenian
race was slowly declining in numbers.</p>

<p>In one respect alone was there little difference
between the sexes at Athens—that of dress. There
was no distinction of sex, as there was no distinction
of rank. In an Attic tragedy a chorus of generals,
of fishermen, and of flower-girls would all appear in
much the same garb. In Asia both sexes wore
trousers (θύλακοι, ‘bags’), which the Greeks regarded
with amused contempt. In Athens neither sex did.
There were some slight varieties in shape, material,
and colour, but, speaking generally, it is correct to say
that an Athenian lady—or an Athenian gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was dressed informally when she or he had one
blanket draped about their person. Full dress consisted
of another blanket over the first, and the art
of dress consisted in suitable pinning and the
proper arrangement of the folds.</p>

<p>But when a woman left her husband’s house and
went abroad, she had to don the symbol of her
slavery, the ‘kredemnon.’ This article was a kind
of yashmak-veil, drawn across the face to protect a
woman from the gaze of strange men, not her lawful
owners. It gave its wearer the white cheeks of the
odalisque, and shut her off from the freedom of the
outside world. It was, like our cap and apron,
the badge of servitude, and to escape from it the
only way was to become a slave indeed, for the
slave-woman alone could walk abroad with open
face.</p>

<p>This is what Euripides means when he makes the
captive Andromache sob: ‘And I, even I, was
dragged from my royal bower down to the sea-beach
with nothing about my head save hideous
slavery.’ (<cite>And.</cite> 109.)</p>

<p>And so Hecuba, in the <cite>Trojan Women</cite>, a slave
bare-footed and bare-headed, crouches on the ground
to escape from the gaze of men, and cries: ‘Guide
me to my bed of straw and to the stones which now
will hide my face.’ (<cite>Trojan Women</cite>, 508.) Slavery
in ancient times was a hard fate, but for many an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Athenian woman it could have had but little terror.
A wife was already the property of her husband,
and slaves and women are commonly classed
together.</p>

<p>The Athenian, however, with all his faults was a
genuine lover of freedom, and did not care for slaves.
Neither his wife nor the flute-girls, whose charms
could be bought by any bidder, could really satisfy
him, strange mixture that he was of sensuality and
intellect. The only women whose company he
desired were those called, half in jest, half in earnest,
the Hetairai, ‘the close companions,’ the same word
being used for those political associations which
formed the closest link between man and man.</p>

<p>The Hetairai were foreign women, and stood outside
the law: they were not Athenian citizens, and so had
no privileges; but, on the other hand, they were
not under restraint. Often highly educated, it was
their business to take part in all men’s interests: they
were their own mistresses, engaged freely in the political
life of Athens, and in many cases exercised very
great influence even in affairs of state. To their personal
attractions they added social charm and a long
training in the arts of pleasure, and the contrast
between them and the Athenian wives may be
illustrated if we compare the life of an actress of the
<cite>Comédie Française</cite> with that of an inmate of a
Turkish harem. The French actress and the Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
geisha are the nearest modern parallels to the
Greek hetaira, and all three owe their existence as
a class to much the same social conditions, a high
standard of culture and intelligence, a low standard
of sexual morality.</p>

<p>Such were the conditions of Athenian life, and
we shall find them reflected in literature. The
great lyric poets, Simonides, Pindar, Bacchylides,
concern themselves almost exclusively with men;
Æschylus alone, in this, as in most things, the exact
antithesis of the typical Athenian, regards women
as creatures possessed of mind and soul. In sharp
contrast to the tragedian is Herodotus, and a comparison
between their views is possible, for, although
the historian is a considerably younger man, a good
deal of his material goes back to an earlier date, and
in social matters especially he often represents the
ideas of the first years of the fifth century.</p>

<p>Herodotus, great traveller and charming personality
though he is, is still a true Ionian. There is
frequently a Milesian flavour about his tales—for
instance the story of Rhampsinitus and the robber—and
it is not unfair to say that in his researches
into ancient tribal life and folklore he is especially
interested in such savage customs as put women in
an inferior place. The account of the native races
of Libya in the last chapters of the fourth book of
the History will afford an example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>But the grandeur of his main theme, the struggle
between Athens and Persia, raised the historian from
these doubtful interests, and in the last five books of
his work there is little depreciation of women as a
class. It is true that women scarcely come into the
narrative, and that Xerxes’ remark about Artemisia,
‘My men have become women and my women have
become men,’ is framed to suit the ideas of an Athenian,
as it would have suited the Romans, who could
hardly conceive of a Queen. It is scarcely as appropriate
in the mouth of a Persian whose own mother,
Atossa, was then acting as regent. But this is a
small point and, speaking generally, there is little in
the last part of the History to offend.</p>

<p>Herodotus is really animated by an ardent patriotism
and a genuine love of liberty. ‘Isonomy,’ he
says—and many English race-goers will agree with
him—‘the very sound of the word is most excellent.’
But it must be remembered that his patriotism is for
males only, and that his equality before the law is
an equality from which women were shut out; for
even Plato makes isonomy between men and women
the last and almost incredible stage of democratic
licence.</p>

<p>So it is in the earlier books alone that the baser
manner is evident, and one example of it will suffice
to give a proof of the difference between the Ionian
spirit which brought about the enslavement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
women and the spirit of enlightenment which rebelled
against that servitude.</p>

<p>We will take the story of Io, as told by Æschylus
and Herodotus, for the ancient legends of Greece,
subjects alike for history and drama, have one
great advantage: their main outlines were impersonal
and known to all; details, treatment, and
interpretation could be varied to express the artist’s
personal thought. Io, the daughter of Inachus,
king of Argos, was beloved by Zeus: through
the jealousy of Hera she was changed into a cow, and
after long wanderings regained her mortal shape
and found rest in Egypt, where she became
mother of Epaphus, first king of the land.
Such is the legend, and this is Herodotus’ version
of it:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Persians say that some Phœnicians once brought
a cargo of merchandise to Argos. The women of the
town, among them Io, came down to the sea-shore
to bargain. The Phœnicians seized the women and
carried them off to Egypt. Now to carry off women
by violence the Persians think is the act of a wicked
man; to trouble about avenging them is the act of
a fool; to pay no regard to them when carried off is
the part of a wise man; for it is clear that, if they had
not wished it themselves, they would not be ravished.
Such is the Persian account, but as regards Io the
Phœnicians do not agree. They say that they used
no violence in taking her to Egypt, but that she had
an intrigue with their captain when he was at Argos.
When she discovered that she was likely to become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
mother she was afraid of her parents, and to hide her
secret came of her own accord with them to Egypt.’</p>

</div>

<p>All the poetry and romance of the story have disappeared:
realism has triumphed. Io is a woman;
on the best interpretation of her conduct she is
vain and imprudent; she shows herself to strange
men, and is carried off by them, although, as the
story is at pains, though not very logically, to add,
it must have been with her own consent. On the
worst interpretation she is a mere wanton. She
allows a sea-captain to seduce her, and then deserts
her home, her parents, and her native land.</p>

<p>Listen now to Æschylus—in the beautiful version
by Mr. E. R. Bevan:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">The chambers, where I housed, a virgin hidden,</div>
<div class="verse">Strange faces aye in the night would visit, wooing</div>

<div class="verse">At large, a separate thing even to the last</div>
<div class="verse">Confines of earth.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The story is the same, but the treatment is different,
and the two passages illustrate the difference
between romantic idealism and realistic depreciation.</p>

<p>But Io, in the <cite>Prometheus</cite>, is only one of the
gallery of Æschylus’ heroines, for in his art women
take the foremost place. The dramatist is at
variance with his age, and his fervent patriotism
is almost the sole bond of union between him and
his fellows. Æschylus is a mystic; he believed in
the Delphic inspiration, and took an interest in
religious speculation. His contemporaries were materialists,
suspected the politics of Delphi, and regarded
religion simply as a ceremony. Æschylus
was a conservative in politics, although a liberal
in thought; Athens was already becoming an
extreme democracy. Finally, Æschylus bases his
theatre on women, and makes them the chief agents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of the drama, while the ordinary woman of his time
was shut out altogether from the active business
of life.</p>

<p>But he is an unconscious feminist, and the definite
purpose which we find in Euripides is quite absent
from his plays. It shows, however, a strange lack
of appreciation to reproach him, as some critics
have done, with neglecting the feminine interest. Of
the seven tragedies that the Byzantine tradition
has preserved for us, four, if their subject was
handled by a modern dramatist, would be called
feminist problem plays, and in the other three the
female characters supply most of the dramatic
interest, even though the first idea of the plot might
seem to put them in the second plan of action.</p>

<p>Of the lost plays, many, as far as we may judge by
their titles and meagre fragments, have the same
characteristic. The most famous, the <cite>Niobe</cite>, had
for its central figure the sorrowing mother, such
another as Euripides’ Hecuba in the first scene of
the <cite>Trojan Women</cite>, and represented perhaps in
much the same fashion, for Æschylus, like most
Athenian women, knew full well the dramatic value
of silence, and the pathos of Niobe’s situation needs
no long speeches. So, if we possessed the <cite>Callisto</cite>,
the legend of the maiden changed into a bear, the
<cite>Penelope</cite>, the <cite>Iphigenia</cite>, or the <cite>Oreithyia</cite>, that
favourite Athenian story of the young girl roaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
on the sea-shore and carried off by the fierce god to
his northern fastness, we should appreciate even
more vividly than we can now the romantic side of
the tragedian’s art. It is a significant fact in this
connection that of the sixty odd titles of lost plays
which have come down to us, nearly half are names
of women. Moreover, in seventeen of these plays,
the title is taken from the chorus, and in the Æschylean
Theatre the chorus is generally the central
figure in the dramatic action. Such titles as the
‘Daughters of the Sun,’ the ‘Nurses of Dionysus,’
the ‘Daughters of Nereus,’ and the ‘Bacchanal
Women,’ suggest at any rate romantic plays with a
strong feminine interest; such others as the ‘Women
of the Bedchamber,’ the ‘Water-carriers,’ and the
‘Women of Etna,’ might well be examples of that
realistic treatment of women’s life of which we have
an example in the Nurse of the ‘Libation-bearers.’
Arguments drawn merely from the names of lost
plays are obviously of little value, except in so far as
they strengthen the definite evidence which the
existing tragedies supply, but an examination of
the remaining seven plays will show that the first
and greatest of Athenian dramatists was deeply
impressed with the potentialities for good and evil
of the female mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI"><span class="smcap">VI.—Æschylus and Sophocles</span></h2>

<p>Of the seven plays of Æschylus that remain, three—the
<cite>Seven against Thebes</cite>, the <cite>Persians</cite>, and the
<cite>Prometheus</cite>—are concerned with battles, and with
strife among men and among gods. It might be
expected that women here would play but a small
part, but, as a matter of fact, in two of the three
the chorus, the intermediary between poet and
audience, is composed of women, and in the third a
woman is the chief character.</p>

<p>The <cite>Seven against Thebes</cite> is a patriotic drama,
‘crammed full of the spirit of war,’ as the poet
himself describes it, and also full of speeches. The
male characters talk; what little action there is in
the play falls to the women of the chorus. Their
first song, for example, when they call on the gods
to save them from the ravages of war, was probably
accompanied by more vigorous movements than
anything in the rest of the tragedy. The unsympathetic
male, Eteocles, addresses them, it is true,
as ‘unbearable creatures’ and ‘detestable animals,’
and says, ‘For my own part, I never want to share
my house with any womankind, nor take them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
my troubles and my joys;’ but his remarks are
strictly in keeping with his unpleasant character,
and the poet instinctively relies on the female characters
for his chief dramatic interest. So in the
<cite>Persians</cite>, a chronicle play composed mainly of choral
odes and messengers’ speeches, the queen-mother,
Atossa, takes the first place in the action, and the
psychological contrast lies between her womanly
strength and Xerxes’ manly weakness. In the
<cite>Prometheus</cite>, certainly, most of the characters—gods
and demi-gods—are males, but they have little
dramatic significance. As far as they are concerned,
the play is a good example of what Maeterlinck
calls the ‘static drama.’ The characters stand still,
<em>and talk</em>. The action is in the hands of the female
characters, the pathetic figure of the wandering
cow-maiden, Io, and the contrasted group of the
mermaid chorus, the daughters of the sea. These
latter are perhaps the most charming of all the
poet’s creations, and the fragrance that heralds
their approach, when, casting away modesty, they
venture to appear before a man, spreads through the
whole play. Sympathising, but not quite without
merriment; inquisitive, but staunch in the hour of
danger; they are just such characters as Nausicaa
herself.</p>

<p>In these three plays, then, the feminine interest
has forced its way, as it were, into the plot, which in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
its first form offered women no place. The <cite>Seven
against Thebes</cite>, a ‘fragment from the table of Homer,’
differs chiefly from the epic in the feminine element
that has been imported by the chorus; the <cite>Persians</cite>,
dealing with the same events as those described by
Herodotus, has for its point of difference the prominence
given to the female character, Atossa; the
<cite>Prometheus</cite>, which tells the story of the conflict
between the fierce young god and the philanthropic
old demiurge, relies for its dramatic interest largely
on the episodes of the Nereides and Io; episodes
which, strictly speaking, have nothing to do with the
main plot.</p>

<p>This feminism, inherent in the poet’s mind, finds
full expression in the remaining four plays. The
<cite>Suppliant Women</cite>, for example, archaic though it
seems to us, deals with a social problem and a question
of law, which was hotly debated in the poet’s
time, and finally, in spite of his advocacy, settled
against the women. The question is this—‘Should
a woman be compelled to marry a man she dislikes,
and to hand over to him the control of her property,
merely because he is the nearest male relative?’
Æschylus answers in the negative; Athenian law
<em>decided in the affirmative</em>.</p>

<p>The characters in the play are nearly all women,
the fifty daughters of Danaus, accompanied by their
old father, who have fled from Egypt to Greece in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
order to escape from the violence of their cousins,
the sons of Ægyptus, who wish to marry them by
force. It is a lyric drama, and the burden of the
action and the music rests with the women. The
agony of the crowd of girls crouching helpless at
the altar is depicted in the most entrancing melody;
they are not regarded as separate individuals, but
as representing women in general; their plight is
that of all womankind, and the problem is presented
as universal. Swarthy daughters of the South,
they call upon their god to help them, the god who
once found delight in the arms of their ancestress,
Io; and in the play their prayer is answered. The
King of Argos protects and gives them shelter, the
Egyptian herald who would have taken them back is
scornfully dismissed. Of the three male characters
Danaus is the most interesting, and his advice to his
daughters is applicable to women generally in
ancient times:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Children, you must be prudent: let your utterance
be attended before all by absence of boldness: a modest
face and a tranquil eye: no wanton looks. Be not
forward in your speech nor prolix: people here are
very prone to take offence. And remember to be
submissive—you are needy foreign fugitives—it is not
seemly for the weak to be bold in speech.</p>

</div>

<p>So in his concluding words he hints at some of the
difficulties of a woman’s life:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I charge you, bring me not to shame, you whose
youthful bloom is so attractive to men. Ripe tender
fruit is never easy to protect; men are like animals,
they seek only to destroy. Your gardens fair, the lady
of love herself proclaims their dewy freshness, and when
a virgin comes in dainty loveliness every man as he
passes by falls victim to desire, and shoots a swift
glance to win her fancy.... Observe, then, this
your father’s charge, and value chastity more than
life itself.</p>

</div>

<p>The <cite>Suppliant Women</cite> presents one particular
phase of women’s subjection considered impersonally,
and scarcely deals with the great question of
how far force may be rightly met by force. In the
legend the daughters of Danaus escape from slavery
by killing their husbands on their wedding night,
but of that Æschylus in this play tells us nothing.</p>

<p>The problem, however, is too vital to escape his
notice, and it forms the central motive of the greatest
play in world-literature, the <cite>Agamemnon</cite>. ‘Is a
woman ever justified in killing her husband?’ The
question had a special interest in Athens, as it must
have in any society where women are kept enslaved,
for the tyrant always walks in dread of the assassin’s
knife. Euripides, with his stinging irony, reveals
the secret fear: ‘If women are to be allowed to shed
male blood,’ he makes Orestes cry, ‘then we men
had better commit suicide at once; if it is a matter
only of the will to kill, we may be sure that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
women have that already.’ The <cite>Agamemnon</cite> deals
with this problem; the sequel plays with a second
question, ‘Is it right for a son to kill his mother in
order to avenge his father’s death?’</p>

<p>But the trilogy of the <cite>Oresteia</cite>, besides being concerned
with feminist problems, is a living gallery of
woman types: Clytemnestra and Cassandra, Electra
and the Nurse, the chorus of maidens in the
<cite>Choephoroi</cite>, and the chorus of women furies in the
<cite>Eumenides</cite>. In the <cite>Agamemnon</cite> the two women are
sharply contrasted; Clytemnestra, the queen who
will not submit to man’s rule; Cassandra, the
victim predestined by fate to suffer the caprices of
a master, and to pass from the treacherous lover,
Apollo, to the brutal owner, Agamemnon. No one
can read the play and feel much sympathy with the
murdered king. He is done to death with every
circumstance of horror; returning home after many
years’ absence in a foreign land, where he has been
fighting for his country, he finds within his house
not a faithful wife, but a secret enemy; she conceals
her hatred, allures him to the bath, and there, with
her own hands, murders him.</p>

<p>And yet the dramatist, and his readers, find the
wife rather than the husband the sympathetic
character. It is partly the intolerable callousness
and brutal pride of Agamemnon, who has sacrificed
his daughter’s life to help on his political schemes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and now brings home with him from Troy the
concubine whom he has compelled to share his bed.
But there is also the feeling that Clytemnestra is
really the better man of the pair: that she is naturally
born to rule, and that her subjection to a man
would be against the law of nature. Certainly in
the play she takes the first place, and Cassandra,
a part vocally the most important of any, comes next.
The men, Agamemnon, the Watchman, the Herald,
Ægisthus, and the helpless chorus of aged councillors,
are merely foils to the ‘manlike’ queen. The
contrast, indeed, between the resolute woman and
the irresolute men in the closing scenes is almost
comic, and the play ends with her triumph. In the
sequel, <cite>The Libation Bearers</cite>, the main action is
again in the hands of women, Electra and her friends,
the maidens of the chorus. Orestes, it is true, does
the actual killing; but there is this difference between
brother and sister: Electra acts on her own initiative,
and is a woman as strong-willed as Clytemnestra
herself; Orestes acts only in obedience to the
promptings of others. Electra feels no remorse;
Orestes, as soon as he has killed his mother, is
tormented by imaginary terrors. Among the characters
of the second play, by far the most interesting
is the old Nurse. She is obviously studied from the
life, and is one of the most vivid figures of Greek
Drama: her kindly temper and affection for her former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
charge are contrasted with the fierce bitterness
of Electra, and she supplies the one touch of humour
that lightens the mournful music of this play.</p>

<p>Last comes the <cite>Eumenides</cite>, which discusses with
almost embarrassing frankness the physical problems
of relationship. ‘Is the mother who conceives, or
the father who begets the child, the nearer relative?’
And again, ‘Is not the murder of a husband, who is
no relation by blood, less heinous than the murder of
the mother who brought you into the world?’
These are some of the questions that are raised but
not answered, for the final reconciliation satisfies
the religious rather than the practical sense. The
plot may be put briefly:</p>

<p>A band of women are pursuing a man over the
earth; pursuing relentlessly until he shall die of
fatigue. Whenever the pursuit slackens, another
woman—or rather her spirit—urges on the chase.
The man appeals in vain for help from men, and at
last a third woman by skilful diplomacy persuades
the avengers—or at least some of them—to agree to
a reconciliation.</p>

<p>Such is the Æschylean theatre; but, as we have
said, Æschylus is a lonely spirit in Athens. The
general view of women is represented by the next
generation, Pericles, Sophocles, and Thucydides,
the greatest statesman, dramatist, and historian of
their time. The last of the three is particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
significant. You may read through his History from
beginning to end—and if you are a student of affairs
you will not find any other book in the world quite
so valuable—but, concerning one-half of the human
race, you will get scarcely a word. Even in the
hortatory speeches, when soldiers are being encouraged
to fight for their possessions, women only come
in the second place after the children. In the rest
of the History they are practically never mentioned.</p>

<p>To Thucydides, women, even such a woman as
Aspasia, hardly existed. Politics were to him the
serious business, war the great game of life, and in
neither of these did women take part. He probably
would have agreed with his hero Pericles, ‘a woman’s
highest glory is not to fall below the standard of such
natural powers as she possesses: that woman is
best of whom there is the least talk among men,
whether in the way of praise or blame.’</p>

<p>In his indifference the historian faithfully follows
the example of the statesman. Pericles, of whose
mistress, Aspasia, we hear so much, and of whose
wife, the mother of his sons, we hear so little,
appears never to have considered the part that nature
has assigned to women in the creation and management
of a state. In his day Athens was faced by
a war that in one year robbed her of many of the
bravest of her sons. A state funeral was given them
at which, as Thucydides tells us: ‘Any one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
wished, stranger or citizen, could be present: even
women were there to mourn for their relatives at
the grave.’ At the end of the ceremony Pericles
made that Funeral Oration in praise of Athens
of which echoes are to be found in all contemporary
Greek literature. Most of the speech dwells
resolutely on the glory of these heroic deaths and
the grandeur of the sacrifices made, but at the last
the orator condescends to human feeling and addresses
some noble words of comfort to the men before
him, taking them in succession as fathers, sons, and
brothers of the dead. Then comes the one final cold
sentence addressed not to the mothers, but to the
widows in his audience: ‘a few words of advice,’
Pericles calls it, and it is the language of reproof
rather than that of sympathy.</p>

<p>Their ignorance of women made even the greatest
minds in Athens insensible to women’s true position,
and in the case of Thucydides there is a further
reason. When the historian came to compose his
work he was too bitterly disillusioned to concern
himself with anything but his main subject, the failure
of Athens to maintain the Periclean system.
In a world where blind chance seemed to rule and the
highest political ideals went unrealised, the social
position of women may well have seemed to him a
trifle.</p>

<p>But Thucydides’ testimony is chiefly negative:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
we get clearer evidence from Sophocles. Sophocles
is the typical Athenian, versatile and ingratiating,
‘<i>eutrapelos, eukolos</i>.’ Actor, poet, priest, and general,
he was one of the most popular men of his time—<em>with
men</em>. Of his family life we have not quite such
a brilliant picture. His wife is one of the many
anonymous women, the wives of great men. His
children did not apparently regard their father with
as much affection as did the outside world, and in his
old age tried to deprive him of the control of his
property. As to women, and the softer affections
of life, outside his own writing we have the anecdote
in Plato’s <cite>Republic</cite>. The poet in his old age was
asked how he felt in regard to love: ‘Hush, hush,’
he replied; ‘I have escaped and right gladly. I
feel like a slave who has escaped from a mad master.’</p>

<p>That was the feeling which the conditions of life
at Athens engendered. Woman and woman’s love
was a necessary weakness: happy the man who
could break free, and if we believe the stories in
Athenæus, Sophocles also in escaping from women
fell into the Ionian snare. In his plays women are
generally a negligible quantity; at least the only
women whom he succeeds in making lifelike are the
slave women, the ministering angels like Deianira
and Tecmessa who meekly respect their master’s
words, ‘oft dinned into their ears’—‘Woman, for
women silence is the finest robe.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Tecmessa, beautiful character though she is, and
far superior to Ajax in moral strength, has no independent
existence apart from her lord and master.
Deianira, deserted by her errant husband, has no
thought of resentment: she only wants to get her
master back, and is prepared to stoop to any means
if she may regain his company. And it is obvious
that these two ladies, who would make a modern
woman despair, are Sophocles’ ideals of feminine
excellence.</p>

<p>Of the other plays, the <cite>Œdipus Tyrannus</cite> contains
only one woman character—Jocasta; the mother
married to her own son, a dreadful figure, and one
almost impossible to dramatise successfully. In
the play she takes only a minor part, and her silent
exit is the most effective touch; but it is interesting
here to compare Sophocles with Euripides, who in
the <cite>Phœnician Women</cite> does succeed in making
Jocasta a real and most pathetic figure. The
<cite>Œdipus at Colonus</cite> has the two girls, Antigone and
Ismene, but they are sexless and dramatically only
important as types of girlish devotion. The <cite>Philoctetes</cite>,
like the two Œdipus plays, has a male chorus
and alone among Greek tragedies, if we except the
<cite>Rhesus</cite>, has no female characters. It is also, whatever
the reason, the dullest play we possess.</p>

<p>There remain the <cite>Electra</cite> and the <cite>Antigone</cite>, and
the first of these is a signal example of the importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
for a dramatist of choice of subject. Æschylus and
Euripides have both left us plays dealing with the
same story, and a comparison with the three tragedies
will reveal the essential differences between the three
poets. A dramatist must share—imaginatively at
least—in his characters’ thoughts; and women like
Clytemnestra and Electra were so beyond the range
of Sophocles’ experience and sympathy that he is
quite unable to make them live. Like everything
that Sophocles wrote, the <cite>Electra</cite> is full of literary
accomplishment. The epic method, for example,
is most ingeniously adapted to the theatre, and
a vivid narrative of the chariot race in which Orestes
is supposed to meet his death forms the centre of
the play, but there is no real grip on the dramatic
situation: it is literature, not life.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Antigone</cite>, on the other hand, the poet is
dealing with a subject thoroughly congenial to his
temperament, the conflict between law and the
individual, and one independent of sex, and the play
is a magnificent example of his art.</p>

<p>Here certainly the central figure is a woman, or,
at least, a girl; but the interest does not depend
upon her sex, for little dramatic use is made of the
Hæmon episode. It is not her sex but her social
position that affects the problem of the play, a
problem vital enough in itself without any sex
interest—‘How far is an individual justified in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
setting his or her conscience against the law of the
State?’</p>

<p>Antigone is a girl orphan, born out of legal wedlock,
a slave without a master; and it is a crowning stroke
of irony to pit her lonely figure against the majesty
of man-made law. To modern readers she seems
intensely pathetic, and an Athenian audience would,
doubtless, have sympathised with her as a rebel, if
not as a woman. There is no word in Greek for ‘to
command,’ and their only word for ‘to obey’ means
literally ‘to allow oneself to be persuaded,’ so that
the conscientious objector was not uncommon. But
Sophocles had been a general, and knew by experience
the way of Athenian soldiers, and it is not certain
that he appreciates his heroine’s wilfulness in quite
so favourable a light; for, as we see in his other
plays, he was essentially on the side of law. He was
rather an observer, with a wonderful command of
language, than an original thinker or critic of the
established order; and it is a curious turn of fortune
for a poet, who had by no means a close or a sympathetic
knowledge of woman’s character, that the
<cite>Antigone</cite>, the only play where a woman takes a vital
part, should be by far the greatest of his works.</p>

<p>The titles and fragments of his lost plays confirm
the impression given by the extant tragedies. We
have nearly a hundred names of lost plays, and
barely one-fifth are called after women. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
a consideration of the titles of those plays that bear
one woman’s name will reveal the fact that the majority
were probably rather anti-feminist than feminist.
Helen, Eriphylë, Pandora, Procris, Tyro: Helen,
who deserted her husband and her home; Eriphylë,
who sold her husband for gold; Pandora, the incarnate
cause of trouble among men; Procris,
bought by a paramour; Tyro, seduced by a second
lover: the legends of these ladies were arranged
to please the Athenian public. Venal and fickle
creatures, they show plainly how necessary it is to
keep a close guard over women, and it may be suspected
that Sophocles, in his treatment of the plot,
did not disappoint the expectations of his audience.</p>

<p>In five plays only is the title taken from the chorus,
the <cite>Spartan Women</cite>, the <cite>Lemnian Women</cite>, the
<cite>Water-carriers</cite>, the <cite>Women of Scyros</cite>, and the <cite>Captive
Women</cite>; and it is very unlikely, considering the titles,
that any one of the five was written with much
sympathy with feminine ideals. ‘Spartan’ and
‘Lemnian’ women were at Athens almost proverbial
for ‘unwomanly’ females; a ‘Water-carrier’ was
synonymous with a gossip. Of the other two we
have a little definite information. Philostratus tells
us that the <cite>Women of Scyros</cite> treated of the not very
pleasant tale of the young Achilles, disguised as a
girl in the king’s harem, and becoming there the
father of Neoptolemus, by the young princess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Deidameia. Of the <cite>Captive Women</cite> we know that
it had the same plot as Euripides’ <cite>Trojan Women</cite>,
but the incidents were treated—<em>humorously</em>. It is
not, perhaps, impossible that an author even to-day
might regard the troubles of women in war as a fit
subject for a jest; but things have advanced so far
that we should hardly regard him now as a flawless
genius, or hold him up as the highest product of
our civilisation.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII"><span class="smcap">VII.—Euripides</span></h2>

<p>All Greek literature has one peculiar quality. As
the tribe of scholiasts and translators have found
from the beginning, it lends itself to interpretation;
and Euripides has suffered more than most authors
from his interpreters. The ancient belief that
Euripides was a misogynist is still sometimes held,
and such a misconception is not altogether our
own fault. It is partly due to Euripides himself,
for the poet’s favourite weapon is irony, and irony
is a double-edged sword which can be turned against
those who dare to use it. Euripides does not say
plainly and straightforwardly ‘You men think
yourselves naturally superior to women: braver,
more truthful, more unselfish: in reality this superiority
is a mere figment of your imagination.’
Neither the poet nor his audience would have cared
for such brutal frankness. Euripides exhibits the
facts of life, with some little malicious arrangement,
and leaves the judgment to others. He is too good
an artist, as indeed were Æschylus and Sophocles,
to make all his women angels and all his men the
reverse. Many of his women have very obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
faults, so that if you come to his plays with a fixed
and comfortable conviction of the superiority of
man, and can shut your eyes to more than half of
the action you will probably find in what remains
convincing proof of woman’s weakness.</p>

<p>But often our belief in Euripides’ misogyny has
quite another source: our inveterate habit of taking
a joke seriously. Aristophanes, who probably knew
Euripides—the man and his plays—better than
anyone in this world, represents him as a woman-hater
in danger from woman’s vengeance. We
draw the inference that Euripides did really dislike
women.</p>

<p>Now the exact opposite of the truth was what the
audience at the performance of an Attic comedy
expected. It was allowed, it was considered proper
in the case of a comic poet, that he should turn his
facts upside down. Socrates, for example, always
professed himself unable to teach anything and
thought the practice of taking fees for teaching
immoral. <em>Therefore</em>, he is represented in the
‘Clouds’ as keeping a school and teaching for hire.
Euripides is the champion of woman’s equality;
<em>therefore</em>, he is represented by Aristophanes as a
misogynist.</p>

<p>There are similar cases in our own social life. An
intelligent foreigner, if he read our literature at the
time of a general election and took the election posters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
seriously, would form a very wrong idea of the estimation
in which—we will say the Prime Minister—is
held by most of his countrymen. A perversion
of the facts is even with us regarded as humorous
in politics, and it is thus that we should regard
Aristophanes. Classical scholars, however, have
always been a serious class and while they recognise
the grossness of Aristophanes they often fail to see
his humour. The irony of Euripides and the humour
of Aristophanes are both alien to the Puritan spirit,
when they are understood, and to appreciate the
first it is necessary to make a close study of all the
plays. Euripides was, first of all, a dramatist, and
his main business is with his play. But behind the
playwright stands the poet and idealist, a man not
at all inclined to look on life with philosophic
detachment, but feeling, as deeply and as bitterly
as any man has ever done, the basis of
injustice on which too often human society has
been reared.</p>

<p>Euripides championed the cause of woman’s freedom
against the decadents of Ionia as he championed
the cause of religious freedom against the reactionaries
of Delphi. He realised that the best method
of defence is to attack the other side: that successful
defence is impossible, unless at any rate you are
prepared to take the aggressive. Open militancy in
his case was impossible, for the dramatic poet was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
ostensibly a servant of the state and the majority,
but by no means all, of his countrymen supported
the doctrines of the infallibility of the Delphian god
and the Athenian man, so that he is compelled to
work in exactly the opposite method to that of the
misogynists. He does not labour his argument:
he does not paint with a heavy brush. If you like
to disregard this point of view you can do so, and
still find much that is supremely interesting—his
gift of vivid narrative, the light music of his verse,
and his unrivalled sense of dramatic effect. But
every dramatist, consciously or unconsciously, has
some groundwork of thought, some criticism of life,
which will appear more or less plainly through the
dramatic action of his plays. In Euripides that
criticism is directed chiefly to the testing of three
assumptions current in his day: that God reveals
his purposes to men, that war has an ennobling
effect on a nation and on individuals, that women are
by nature inferior to men.</p>

<p>With the first two of these dogmas we are not now
concerned. As to the real nature of Euripides’
ideas on the third, we shall get the clearest view if
we consider first the characters of his theatre, then
the general body of his plays, and lastly, those four
dramas which are particularly concerned with the
relations between men and women.</p>

<p>The two sexes may be sub-divided, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Greek fashion, into six classes: Old man, man,
young man, old woman, woman, young woman;
and it must be acknowledged at once that Euripides,
like most Greeks, is quite lacking in any reverence
for age. His old men are apt to be dotards and are
treated with humorous contempt. Amphitryon in
the Hercules is a type: he lives in a world of illusion:
he sees visions and dreams dreams, but when serious
counsel or vigorous action are necessary he is useless.
Cadmus and Teiresias in the Bacchæ are characters
of the same sort. They are meant to be humorous,
and the scene in which the two old men, wagging
their hoary heads, prepare to dance and sing is pure
burlesque. Cadmus agrees with Amphitryon in
his religious views: he is ready to accept the miraculous,
if it is profitable; and he scarcely troubles
to make any pretence. As regards the divinity of
the new god Dionysus, his sentiments are that, as
‘The fellow anyhow is my daughter’s son: it is my
duty as head of the family to make out that he is
a great god’. Cadmus and Amphitryon are at least
partly self-deceived; Ægeus is a mere butt. The
old gentleman, who believes that his virility can be
restored by magic art, is a child in Medea’s hands,
and the scene between the two is Aristophanic in
its outspoken frankness.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, old men in Euripides are
impotent: when they are allowed to act, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
energies—Tyndareus for example, and the old servant
in the Ion—are mischievous. In one case
only do old men play a worthy part; when they
are resisting the wanton violence of some full-grown
man who is attacking women and children.
Sometimes, as with Peleus and Iolaus, they succeed;
sometimes they fail; but in either case their
essential weakness is a foil to the presumptuous
strength of their opponent.</p>

<p>Coming now to the second class, that of grown
men, we get three main types: there is the mean
man, the blusterer, and the simpleton. Jason and
Admetus are mean men: mean, selfish and cowardly:
capable of asking a woman to save their lives at the
risk of her own, but incapable of gratitude. Still
they are handsome, good company, and quite unconscious
of their own shortcomings. Menelaus is
a worse type and one that the poet especially disliked.
He adds to meanness the vices of cruelty and treachery
and is the slave of passion. In the Orestes he
is coldly treacherous, in the Andromache treacherous
and cruel, in the other plays where he appears
merely despicable. Then come the blusterers:
Agamemnon and Heracles, Lycus and Eurystheus.
The first two are the ordinary sensual man: brave
enough and capable of great deeds, but unfaithful,
untruthful and self-indulgent: they seem to be
strong, and they are strong in body; but they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
no strength of mind. Lycus and Eurystheus are
men of a lower type, mere bullies depending solely
on force, and Euripides does not attempt to make
them interesting. Lastly, there are the simpletons:
Xuthus, Thoas and Theoclymenus—an easy prey for
the clever women—the Priestess, Iphigenia, Helen
who use them as they will. They are the men who
with advancing age will be such as Ægeus and
Amphitryon. And they almost exhaust the list in
our second class. There remain only Theseus, a
patriotic abstraction, the male counterpart of Athena;
Creon, ‘the King’—the name is given to more than
one person—an official rather than a living character;
and some few persons in the second plan of action:
such as the herald Talthybius and the peasant
farmer in the Electra. These two latter occupy
very subordinate positions, but they are in every
way more manly, more generous, more lovable
than the great men whom they serve. If we
except them, there is not a grown man in the whole
theatre of Euripides who can be regarded with
sympathy.</p>

<p>When we come to the young men we are in a
brighter world. Euripides is essentially the poet
of youth, and his younger characters are always
lovable. The heroic boy Menœceus and the kind
lad Ion are figures drawn with a tender hand.
But soon the shadows of the prison house draw in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and the slight hardness which is visible even in
Ion becomes intensified in Achilles, and still more in
Hippolytus. The older the person, the less attractive
he becomes. Achilles and Hippolytus are
very much like the public school boy of our day;
in many spheres of conduct they are thoroughly
reliable: truthful, self-denying and courageous:
but they are cruelly hampered by the influence of
an environment which shuts out the influence of
woman at the most impressionable time of a man’s
life. Hippolytus is something of a prig and into his
mouth, in the well-known speech, Euripides puts all
the stock invective against women. The words
are not the lad’s own views: he is too young to have
had much experience of women, good or bad: they
are literature, the views of other men expressed in
books and unconsciously assimilated by the younger
generation.</p>

<p>Hippolytus is an ascetic and exaggerates: Achilles
is a more manly character. His first impulses are
generous, but he does not carry them into effect, for
he is too much under the influence of other people’s
opinion: ‘good form’ is his guide in life. He has
moreover, all a young man’s vanity. ‘Countless
girls are setting traps to catch me as husband’ he
says; and he is deeply hurt to think that he is not
consulted—‘I would have agreed to her death, if I
had been asked, but I was not; so I will help you.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
This is the best champion that Clytemnestra can
find to save her daughter.</p>

<p>The remaining five characters, men unmarried,
but full-grown, are less interesting. Pentheus is
the typical ‘self-pleaser’: wilful, violent and intolerant.
That he happens to be right in his particular
case does not make him more sympathetic nor
does it alter the justice of his fate. His mode of
thought is wrong. Savage repression is not the way
to deal with a cause which enlists women as its chief
votaries and is kept active by their enthusiasm.
The other pairs, Orestes and Pylades, Eteocles and
Polynices, require little notice. All four have the
curse of Cain upon them: they draw the sword and
fall by the sword. They are murderers first and
foremost, and chiefly interesting to the criminologist.</p>

<p>So much then for Euripides’ men. Let us now
contrast them in their monotony of type—impute
it to the poet or the sex as you will—with the infinite
variety of his women: Phædra, Andromache, Hermionë,
Creüsa, Megara, Helen, Alcestis, Clytemnestra,
Medea. There is every shade of conduct here and
nearly every form of marital complication, if we
remember that none of these wives are in love with
their husbands and that romantic affection between
husband and wife is impossible. They are all—when
they have children—mothers first and wives
afterwards; the childless woman—Hermionë and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
apparently, Creüsa—is embittered by her state and
her conduct also is abnormal: she is anxious to take
life because she has not given life.</p>

<p>The poet is at pains to show the impossibility of
married love under Greek conditions. Phædra is
married to an old man, who years before had seduced
her sister. Andromache has been forcibly taken by
the son of the man who slew her first husband. Hermionë
has been compelled for political reasons to
give up her cousin-lover and marry a stranger.
Medea after abandoning everything for her husband
is deserted by him. Creüsa has been seduced as a
girl and as a ‘pis aller’ has married an elderly man.
Megara has been abandoned by her roving husband:
she and her children are on the point of being killed
by a stranger when Heracles returns and murders
them himself. Helen runs away from her lord;
Clytemnestra has no words bad enough to use of
hers.</p>

<p>None of these women are impeccable—Alcestis is
the only flawless character and she is meant to be a
saint—their tempers are as composite as we find them
in real life; but, however wrong or mistaken some of
their actions may be, not one is altogether unsympathetic.
So with the old women. They are sometimes
malignant, but they are never contemptible.
Their worst deeds are prompted by maternal affection.
Phædra’s foster-mother is a mischievous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
immoral old lady, but her only wish is to gratify
her foster child. Hecuba takes a ruthless vengeance
on the Thracian king, but she is a mother avenging
a murdered son. It is a favourite motive with
Euripides; the pathos of the old mother, her sons
killed, her daughters ravished, her grandchildren
sold into slavery. Hecuba in the <cite>Trojan Women</cite>,
Jocasta in the <cite>Phœnician Women</cite>, the chorus of old
women in the <cite>Suppliants</cite>: all represent the reverse
side of war’s pomp and glory. The men triumph
and the women suffer. The method is realistic:
there is little romance, in the baser sense of the word,
in these unkempt, miserable, old figures, and yet
they supply the poet with some of his most poignant
passages.</p>

<p>But Euripides is especially successful with his
pictures of young girls, virgin martyrs—the type is
not extinct—anxious and willing to sacrifice themselves
for their male relatives. Iphigenia, Polyxena
and Macaria are subtle variations of one character,
and upon the figure of the first the poet spends all
his skill. At the time of the sacrifice at Aulis she is
a sentimental girl, so full of timid modesty that the
very thought of marriage fills her with shame.
‘I hid my face,’ she says, ‘in the soft wrappings of
my veil and would not take my baby brother in
my arms nor kiss my sister on the lips—I felt ashamed
before them. No, I laid up for myself many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
fond embrace which I would give them when I
should come back, a married woman.’ The arguments
she uses to her mother to justify her sacrifice
are poor enough: vague talk of honour, patriotism
and the insignificance of women—’Tis better that
one man should live than ten thousand women’;
but her heart is right.</p>

<p>For Iphigenia both marriage and sacrifice prove
a delusion. She never returns home; she is defrauded
of the joy of motherhood, and spends many
years of lonely virginity among strangers and in a
strange land. When we see her again she is a bitter
woman, more sensible, indeed, than the simple girl,
but infinitely less lovable. Her thoughts are all
of vengeance: against Menelaus, against Helen,
against mankind. She performs her horrible task
of human sacrifice with no very great reluctance;
‘Parcelling out a tear in sympathy for kindred
blood’ when any Greek victims fall into her hands;
but killing them all the same. For one person alone
she still cherishes some affection, her brother Orestes,
whom she had left a baby at home, and on him she
concentrates her frustrated motherhood.</p>

<p>The final stage of this rancour against life is seen
in the character of Iphigenia’s sister Electra—‘the
unwed’—as we have her in the Orestes and the play
that bears her name.</p>

<p>Electra’s loneliness and suffering, her long brooding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
her craving for revenge have turned her mad:
she again has only one sound sentiment, her love
for her brother. She is a dreadful figure, but a real
one. Fire and the knife: murder, treachery, arson:
she is ready for all. Her character is the logical
outcome of many years of injuries and insults:
of denial of rights and of subjection. She is a proud
spirit and will not submit, but her pride cannot alter
the situation. At last the strain of hopeless rebellion
is too great, and she becomes mad.</p>

<p>They make, indeed, a gloomy picture, these unmarried
women, for Euripides does not shrink from
the darker side of a woman’s revolt. As Medea
bitterly says ‘Even a bad husband is better than
none,’ and for the unwedded girl there are only
two alternatives, a voluntary sacrifice, such as that
whereby Macaria escapes from life, or a hopeless
struggle against the powers that be, such as Electra
tries to wage.</p>

<p>We have now taken all the characters of the
Euripidean theatre, except one, and that one the
most important of all—the permanent character of
tragedy, the chorus.</p>

<p>The chorus is the ideal spectator, the intermediary
between audience and actor, the interpreter of the
poet’s own thoughts. It might be expected that a
poet who was a feminist at heart would usually
have his chorus composed of women, while a poet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
who had little sympathy with women would prefer
a chorus of men. In our extant plays this is exactly
what happens. It is a curious fact that most of the
received ideas about the Greek drama; the chorus
of elders, the statuesque movements, the dignity
of tragedy, etc., etc., are drawn from the theatre
of Sophocles, the most academic of the three dramatists:
they would never be deduced from the usage
of Æschylus or Euripides.</p>

<p>In the seven plays of Æschylus, the chorus is composed
five times of women, twice only of men.
In both cases they are old men, and the weakness
of their old age is necessary to the dramatic action.
In Sophocles the proportion is exactly reversed.
The chorus is five times composed of men, twice of
women. Moreover, it is not the dramatic action that
fixes either the sex or the age of the chorus in the
Œdipus Tyrannus, the Œdipus Colonus, or the
Antigone. In the latter play, indeed, most readers
will feel that a chorus of women would be more
appropriate; the chorus with Sophocles are old
men because the old man is the poet’s ideal
character.</p>

<p>Of the seventeen plays of Euripides, in only three
cases—the Heracles, the Heraclidæ and the Alcestis—is
the chorus composed of men. In the first two
cases, as in Æschylus, the ineffectiveness of old men
in actual danger is part of the plot; the chorus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
strengthens the impression made by Iolaus and
Amphitryon. In the Alcestis, that the chorus are
men is part of the general irony of the play.</p>

<p>In the other fourteen plays the chorus is composed
of women, and it is into the mouth of these women
that Euripides puts all the most intimate part of
his work. Sometimes it is a scene of home life as
in the Hecuba where a woman describes her last
night in Troy.</p>

<p>‘It was at midnight that ruin came. Dinner was
over and upon men’s eyes sweet sleep began to spread.
All the songs had been sung: my lord had done with
the sacrificial feast and its revelry and was lying
in my bower, spear on peg, for no longer had he
to keep watch against the throng of shipmen who
had set foot on our Ilian land of Troy. As for me,
one ringlet of hair I had still to bring to order under
my tight-bound snood, and I was gazing into the
infinite reflections of my golden mirror ere I should
throw myself upon the pillows of my bed. But lo!
a cry went through the city and a cheer rang out
in Troy-town—“Sons of the Greeks—when, ah
when, will you sack the watch tower of Ilion and
get you home at last?” Then I fled from my dear
couch, with only my smock upon me, like some
Dorian maid, and crouched by Artemis’ holy shrine.
But woe is me, no help found I there. My own man,
my bed-fellow, I saw slain before me; and then I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
was dragged down to the sea shore, and in anguish
swooned away.’</p>

<p>Sometimes it is a vivid description of outdoor life,
such as the picture of the washing-place, where the
humbler sort of women could meet and enjoy a little
leisure, ‘that pleasant evil,’ and gossip together.
‘There is a rock that drips, men say, with water
from the Ocean’s bed and sends from the cliff an
ever-running stream, for us to catch in our pitchers.
There I met a friend who was washing pieces of
fresh-dyed cloth in the river water and laying them
in the warm sun upon the flat stones. From her
lips first this news of my lady came to me.’</p>

<p>Every mood of a woman’s mind is represented:
now sad—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Discordant is the music of a woman’s life:
pitiable helplessness is her lot, an evil housemate,
indeed. There is the trouble of child birth, the trouble
of woman’s weakness.’—(<cite>Hippolytus.</cite>)</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">or—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘A censorious thing is womankind. If women get
a small basis for scandal they soon add more. Women
take a kind of pleasure in talking insincerely about
one another.’—(<cite>Phoenissae.</cite>)</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">now triumphant—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Children, promise of children’s children to be,</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">or—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A strange and wondrous thing for women are the
children they bear in travail. Womankind loves a
baby.—(<cite>Phoenissae.</cite>)</p>

</div>

<p>All the questions of sex are considered and
judged with clearest sense.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Man’s love when it is excessive is neither excellent
nor, indeed, creditable. But still, sex is a divine thing
and a gracious, if kept within bounds. A moderate
temper, for that I pray: avaunt, contentious anger and
the ceaseless bickering that drives a husband astray
to another woman’s arms.’—(<cite>Medea.</cite>)</p>

</div>

<p>Sometimes the question takes a wider range as in
the difficult chorus of the Iphigenia in Aulis.</p>

<p>‘The stuff of which men and women are made is
different: their ways are different too. But what
is really good, of that there is no doubt. The different
methods of rearing and education have a great
influence on ideas of excellence. Humble modesty
is a form of wisdom; and yet it is wondrous good to
use your own judgment and see your duty for
yourself. Then life is honourable and your frame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
grows not old. It is a great thing to seek after
excellence. For us women the quest is secret down
the secret ways of love; for men the marshalled
state and the thronging crowd make a city to increase
and prosper.’</p>

<p>But the topic on which Euripides insists most is
the scandal of literature, the unfair ideas of woman
that have been created and fostered by the perversity
of writers. Two quotations will suffice. One from
the Ion:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Ye scandal-masters of the lyre,</div>
<div class="verse">That harping still upon the lust</div>
<div class="verse">Of losel women never tire,</div>
<div class="verse">Her lewdness ever, now be just.</div>
<div class="verse">How doth her faith superior show</div>
<div class="verse">Beside the lust of losel man!</div>
<div class="verse">See it, and change your music. Go</div>
<div class="verse">Another way than once ye ran,</div>
<div class="verse">Ye lyric libels, go, and vex</div>
<div class="verse">The faithless found, the elder sex.’—(<cite>Ion. Verrall’s translation.</cite>)</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">another from the Medea:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘It is men now that are crafty in counsel, and keep
not their pledges by the gods; the scandal will turn and
honour come to a woman’s life. ’Tis coming—respect
for womankind. No longer will pestilent scandal
attack women, and women alone. The music of ancient
bards will die away, harping ever on woman’s perfidy.
Phœbus is the guide of melody and in my heart he
never set the wondrous music of his lyre. Else I would
soon have raised a song that would have stayed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
brood of male singers. The long years have many a
tale to tell, of men as well as of women.’</p>

</div>

<p>This last sentence represents Euripides’ reasoned
judgment on the problems of feminism. Women
are different from men, but they are not inferior: all
the arguments that are used to prove woman’s
weakness could be used equally well against men.</p>

<p>So we may leave the characters and turn now to
the separate plays.</p>

<p>Of the complete dramas that we now possess,
the Rhesus is probably spurious, the Cyclops is a
comic play, the Helena is a burlesque of the tragic
manner. Of the remaining sixteen, two, the Suppliant
Women and the Children of Heracles, are
political plays, written to glorify Athens as the
champion of oppressed nationalities, and their
interest is mainly political. But nothing that
Euripides wrote is altogether lacking in vivid
touches of feminism. In the Children of Heracles,
for example, there is one character who in a few words
reveals the position of women in Athenian life:
‘For a woman silence and discretion are best, and
to remain quiet within doors.’ So speaks the maiden
Macaria before she consents to a voluntary death.
She has had bitter experience of life and she is
willing to die, for existence offers her no very
pleasant prospect.</p>

<p>‘A friendless girl—’ she says ‘who will take me for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
his wife? Who will have children by me? It is
better for me to die.’ Her one pathetic desire is
to die, not on compulsion but as a willing sacrifice,—to
escape from life <em>nobly</em> (the word recurs as often
in Euripides as it does in Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler), to
leave the ignoble servitude of woman’s lot. She
begs Iolaus to deal the death-blow and to cover her
dead body. But Iolaus, brave old man though he
is, cannot bring himself to see her die, and her last
request is that at least she may die not among men,
but in the arms of women. These are her final
words: ‘For my people I die. That is my treasure
in death: that I take instead of children and my
virgin bloom; if indeed anything exists below.
I pray for my part that there be <em>nothing</em> there:
if we mortals who must die shall find life’s business
in that land also, I know not where to turn.
Death is counted the surest potion against pain.’</p>

<p>A similar incident forms the most striking scene
of the Suppliant Women. Here it is not a young girl,
but a married woman, Evadne, who of her own accord
goes to death. But her motive is much the same:
‘for the sake of a noble repute I die,’ she cries
‘that I may surpass all women in generous courage.’
Her husband is dead, she is a childless woman, and
she refuses to live on as a widow. Her father is
anxious that she should nurse him in his old age,
but with strange perversity she prefers death and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the old man is left to make lament. ‘My daughter
is dead;’ he cries, ‘she who used to draw down my
face to her lips and would hold my head fast in her
arms. Nothing is so sweet as a daughter when a
father grows old. A son’s life is a thing of greater
importance, but sons are not so pleasant when we
need fond endearments.’</p>

<p>The main interest of the Suppliant Women is the
same as that of three other plays: the Phoenician
Women, the Trojan Women, and the Hecuba.
They are concerned with war; but war, as seen from
the woman’s side, a thing of unredeemed and useless
suffering. All the ‘glory of conquest’ disappears:
women and children are seen paying the price of
men’s ambition and pride. The Trojan Women is
the most lamentable and the most effective of the
series. Written according to the oldest formula of
tragedy, the chorus are the chief persons in the
action. Hecuba, Cassandra and Andromache are
only particular representatives of the sufferings
which all the women in the play endure. The two
male characters, the lustful hypocrite Menelaus and
the honest servant Talthybius are of quite subordinate
interest.</p>

<p>The play is an accumulation of sorrow upon sorrow,
but the climax is the murder of the little child Astyanax,
a political crime, not inspired by any of the
human feelings of hatred and revenge, but coldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
calculated by men for the sake of future advantage.
It is the women, the mother and grandmother of
the child, who have to suffer, that men may sleep
in safety. As Andromache bitterly says, she has
always followed out the whole duty of woman.</p>

<p>‘Those things that have been invented as virtuous
pursuits for women, at those I laboured ever in
Hector’s house. To begin with—whether censure
should attach to women for it or not, I may not say—but
at any rate, the thing in itself brings a woman
an evil name when she does not remain ever within
doors. So I put aside the desire for going out and
stayed at home. Moreover, I never admitted within
our house the fantastic talk that some females enjoy:
I found my own sound sense the best teacher in
domestic matters, and made myself sufficing. A
silent tongue and a quiet face—that was what I
rendered to my lord.’</p>

<p>And now she has her reward: she is to become a
concubine in the house of her husband’s murderer,
and is told that one night in the arms of her new
lord will make her forget the past. As for her baby
boy; ‘dear youngling nestling in your mother’s
arms, your skin so sweet and fragrant,’ he is torn
away and hurled down to death.</p>

<p>But Andromache is not worse treated than the
other women. Hecuba is handed over to Odysseus
to be his slave, to sweep the floor and grind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
daily corn. The virgin Polyxena is reserved to be
slain over the tomb of Achilles; for it is not enough
that living men should make women their chattels;
even the dead hero demands the tribute of a maiden’s
life. Cassandra has lived a vestal, dedicated to the
service of the god, and she too has her reward. The
great king deigns to take her to his bed, and in a
scene of the grimmest irony the unhappy girl sings
her own marriage hymn. There is all the music
of the hymeneal chorus, but we have one solitary
figure—the unwedded bride—instead of the joyful
procession of youths and maidens.</p>

<p>The Hecuba deals with the same events as the
Trojan Women and in the same spirit. The sacrifice
of Polyxena is consummated and Hecuba takes
vengeance on one of her children’s murderers, the
Thracian king Polymnestor. Beguiled into the captive
women’s tent he sees his own children murdered
and is then blinded. The scene where he comes
reeling out with blood-dripping eyes reaches the
limits of the horrible, but Euripides does not forget
to draw the feminist moral.</p>

<p>‘If any one,’ the king says, ‘has spoken ill of
women in the past, or is now in the act of speaking
or will some day speak, I will cut all his words short—listen—Neither
sea nor land breeds such a race
as women are: only the man who has to do with them
from time to time knows what they can do.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>The unhappy victim of a single woman forgets
his logic and imputes the fault of an individual
to the sex. If the aggressor had been a man, his
thoughts would have been different and so the
chorus tell him.</p>

<p>‘Be not over-fierce against us nor bring the
feminine element into your troubles. There is no
need to blame all womankind.’</p>

<p>The particular note of realistic horror that marks
the closing scenes of the Hecuba appears in another
group of four plays, the Iphigenia in Tauris, the
Heracles, the Orestes and the Electra. The first
three have been exhaustively studied by Dr. Verrall,
and it is enough now to say that the methods of
criticism which Thucydides and Euripides use upon
the Trojan War, are here applied to other tales of
the remote and heroic past. Both writers—the
historian and the dramatist—know that human
nature does not change, and they strip away remorselessly
the glamour of ancient legend. If such
things happened, <em>this</em> is how they happened, says
Euripides; and so we have the half-mad, half-heroic
figure of Heracles: the sinister Orestes always
ready to unsheath his dagger: the ludicrous yet
pitiable Phrygian eunuch stuttering and trembling
in panic fear, and most terrible of all the unsexed
woman Electra. Each play has its own scene of
horror, but the climax, perhaps, comes when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Electra takes the head of the murdered Ægisthus
in both hands and pours forth all her bitterness
into the deaf ears.</p>

<p>The Hippolytus strikes an entirely different note,
and is, perhaps, the best known of all the plays. It
has been adapted by Seneca and Racine, used as
material by Ovid and transposed into a romantic
drama by Professor Murray. But in spite of all
this, Phædra’s position and motives are often misunderstood.
Hippolytus is her natural enemy and
the enemy of her children. The bastard son of
Theseus, if his father died, would probably oust the
legitimate but younger children of the wife from
their father’s throne and himself seize the power.
Phædra, a young woman married to an old husband,
is possessed by a physical desire for the young man,
but she struggles against her passion <em>for her children’s
sake</em>. When she finally gives up the struggle, she
secures her children’s safety by ensuring Hippolytus’
death or banishment. She knows Theseus and
she knows that he will bitterly resent any trespass
on his property and punish that trespass with all
the severity in his power. The charge is a false
one, but it is only thus that her children’s future
can be protected.</p>

<p>The last two plays, the Bacchæ and the Iphigenia
in Aulis, written in old age and in exile at Macedonia,
still deal with the double problem, the sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to God and the sacrifice to man; and they are
constructed on the same lines.</p>

<p>In the Bacchæ the men are of three sorts. There
is the Adept—an imposter, who has taken to religion
as a trade; the old men Cadmus and Teiresias who
are ‘religious’ for social and family reasons: finally
the young Pentheus who is openly ‘irreligious’
and comes to a bad end.</p>

<p>The women alone <em>believe</em>: they are deceived by
the adept, and much of their belief is delusion, but
it is a real spiritual benefit—to them. The ritual
of Bacchus was the one chance of escape in a Greek
woman’s life from the stifling seclusion of the harem
home. For a few days at least she became a free
creature, allowed to roam at large upon the mountains.
The thyrsus of the god took the place of
her master’s company: the sky was her roof: the
grass was her bed: she could put aside the wine
press and the flour mill and live on milk and honey.
The ecstasy of such an escape has never found more
intense expression than in the narrative speeches
and the choric songs of the Bacchæ.</p>

<p>In the Iphigenia at Aulis the men again are of
three types, foils all and each to the idealism of
Iphigenia and the practical sense of Clytemnestra.
Menelaus is the meanest: the slave of desire, ready
for any crime to gratify his passions. Agamemnon
is the ordinary middle-aged man, afraid of his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and fond of his family, but capable of deceiving the
one and ruining the other. Achilles is the young
man of the governing classes, brought up to despise
women, and to think that every girl is anxious to
become his wife. The men quarrel and plot for
their own selfish ends, but their schemes are detected
by the keen wit of Clytemnestra and rendered useless
by the unselfish devotion of Iphigenia.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII"><span class="smcap">VIII.—Euripides. The Four Feminist Plays</span></h2>

<p>The three main interests of Euripides’ mind, realist,
pacificist and feminist—to use our ugly jargon—are
to be found in all his theatre; but there are four
plays which are especially concerned with the
relations between women and men, the Alcestis,
Medea, Ion and Andromache. They are not pleasant
plays: indeed, to a lover of sentimental idealism
they would be conspicuously unpleasant if they were
fully understood. Nor are they to be recommended
to women readers. The relations between the
sexes are a delicate thing; and human nature, male
humanity at any rate, is generally none the worse
for discreet reticence and tender handling. But
in these plays Euripides uses the surgeon’s knife.
They were meant for an audience of men, grown
callous by time and custom; and the treatment is
ruthless. They should be regarded as the painful
but necessary operation, needed to rid a patient
of some long-festering ulcer, and the dramatist
deserves the thanks that we give to the skillful
surgeon.</p>

<p>The particular flaws in the male character with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
which Euripides deals in the four plays are these—meanness,
cowardice, selfishness, and treachery.
They are not the faults, it will be noticed, that are
especially appropriate to a ruling class. Man is
not indicted on the score of haughtiness, pride or
cruelty: his weaknesses are of a less ‘manly’ sort.
It is his position as the natural lord of creation that
is questioned and put to the test of dramatic
action.</p>

<p>If Jason, Admetus, Apollo and Menelaus are
<em>impossible</em> characters, then Euripides fails altogether
in his lesson: if their actions, though possible, are
improbable, then again he fails in an artistic sense.
Some may think that no one could be quite so mean
as Jason, quite so cowardly and selfish as Apollo
and Admetus, quite so treacherous as Menelaus;
but if we apply the test of experience, the cruel facts
of life will justify the poet. None of the four are
‘tragedies,’ in the sense in which we use the word.
They are as good examples as we are ever likely to
see of ‘la haute comédie’; the Ion and Andromache,
perhaps, a little melodramatic, the Alcestis
and the Medea in places almost farcical; but all
depending eventually on a subtle study of psychology
and social relationships.</p>

<p>It is probable that they were not originally composed
for public representation in the great theatre
of Dionysus. They are intimate studies of humanity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and can quite easily be divested of the official
chorus, prologue and epilogue, which are independent
of the dramatic action of the play. What
is left is Euripides’ own teaching, put as plainly as
the ironical spirit will allow. The frequency of
translation must not blind us to the fact that in
essentials Euripides is untranslatable. He is one
of the greatest masters of irony and there is nothing
that is so apt to vanish in translation, or create
confusion in the English mind.</p>

<p>All four plays are concerned with problems of
motherhood and children, especially male children.
In three, child-actors are required and play an
important part in the action: the fourth play,
the Ion, has for its hero a lad, just emerging from
the ‘awkward age’ of boyhood.</p>

<p>Between the Ion and the Andromache there is a
curious resemblance of plot. The case was probably
not uncommon in the circumstances of race-degeneration
that prevailed at Athens during the fifth
century. In both plays a husband has a childless
wife, but a son by an irregular union. There are
two women to one man, and in each case there is
another man in the background, Apollo who has
seduced Creüsa, and Orestes who has been the affianced
lover to Hermionë. The husbands, Xuthus
and Pyrrhus, are the least important figures in the
action; indeed, Pyrrhus does not appear in person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
at all. They are represented as colourless characters;
men of position and personal courage, dangerous,
perhaps, when roused, but generally negligible.
Their young wives, Hermionë and Creüsa, regard
them with a mixture of contemptuous fear and
jealous affection.</p>

<p>The interest is concentrated on the women, and the
plays are studies of wifely jealousy—‘Why should
my husband have a child, while I am childless?’—and
maternal love.</p>

<p>Euripides knows well that motherhood is a
woman’s natural sphere: a childless woman is for
him an abnormal woman, and behaves in an abnormal
and anti-social fashion. Both wives attribute
their barrenness, probably the natural result of their
past history, to supernatural causes. Hermionë
believes that the foreign concubine Andromache has
bewitched her: Creüsa, that she has incurred the
anger of a god. Hermionë accordingly proposes
to break the spell by killing the witch; Creüsa goes
to Delphi to propitiate the divinity and seek his
aid.</p>

<p>Both women, also, in their jealous hate are
anxious to kill their husband’s bastard. Hermionë
uses her father’s help and nearly succeeds in murdering
the boy Molossus. Creüsa employs her father’s
old slave as her agent, and all but poisons the boy
Ion. In neither case is the crime accomplished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
for the plays are not ‘tragedies’; but the criminal
purpose is there. The women have been injured
in the past and they are childless. They are
embittered against life and ready to requite evil for
evil. On the other hand, the unwedded mothers
in both plays are ready to sacrifice themselves for
their children. Andromache offers her life to save
her son—‘What pleasure have I in life?’ she cries,
‘In him all my hopes centre: it would be a disgrace
for me not to die on behalf of the child I bore.
Children, indeed, are life: those who in ignorance
disparage them, may feel less pain than we do,
but they are miserable in their happiness.’</p>

<p>In the Ion Pythia consents to an even harder
sacrifice: she hands over her child to another woman,
saves him thereby from the guilt of murder and makes
him prince of Athens. Andromache and the
Priestess have been injured in the past, but they
are saved by their children: the maternal, not the
marital, is the holy state.</p>

<p>But in both plays the feminist interest is complicated
by other motives, political and religious.
In the Andromache a bitter attack is made upon the
Spartan system in the person of Menelaus. ‘You a
man?’ old Peleus cries, ‘You dastard son of dastard
parents. What claim have you to be counted among
men? A fine <em>man</em> it was, a Phrygian, that robbed
you of your wife. You left your hearth and home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
without a lock, without a servant to guard, as though,
forsooth, you had a virtuous wife within doors, she
who was the worst of all women. Why, even if
she wished, none of your Spartan girls could be
virtuous. They leave the shelter of home and go
about with young men; their legs bare, their dresses
open; and run and wrestle like men. It all seems
to be abominable. We need not be surprised that
your system of education does not produce virtuous
women.’</p>

<p>In the Ion the system of Delphi and the oracle is
assailed, and a vein of bitter irony runs through
the play. So ironical is the poet’s method that,
if we take the prologue seriously and confine ourselves
to the statements there made, we are apt to get a
somewhat misleading idea of the play’s purpose.
Dr. Way, for example, who gives the traditional
interpretation with the greatest clearness, supplies
the following summary of the action.</p>

<p>‘In the days when Erechtheus ruled over Athens,
Apollo wrought violence to the king’s young daughter
Creüsa. And she, having borne a son, left him, by
reason of her fear and shame, in the cave wherein
the God had humbled her. But Apollo cared for
him, and caused the babe to be brought to Delphi,
even to his temple. Therein was the child nurtured,
and ministered in the courts of the God’s house.
And in process of time Erechtheus died, and left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
no son nor daughter save Creüsa, and evil days
came upon Athens, that she was hard bestead in
war. Then Xuthus, a chief of the Achæan folk,
fought for her and prevailed against her Eubœan
enemies, and for guerdon of victory received the
princess Creüsa to wife, and so became king-consort
in Athens. But to these twain was no child born;
so, after many years, they journeyed to Delphi to
inquire of the oracle of Apollo touching issue. And
there the God ordered all things so that the lost was
found, and an heir was given to the royal house
of Athens. Yet, through the blind haste of mortals,
and their little faith, was the son well-nigh slain
by the mother, and the mother by the son.’</p>

<p>This summary quite faithfully represents the
statements of the divine Hermes; but Euripides
knows as well as we do that gods do not walk the
earth and that children are not miraculously wafted
through the air. The prologue satisfies convention:
the play itself is realistic and one of the chief characters
is a woman of whom the prologue tells us nothing.
The real plot, as opposed to the idealistic version,
is as follows:—the facts are put down crudely instead
of being conveyed by subtle hints and innuendo as
they are in the Greek.</p>

<p>A young Athenian girl, Creüsa, wandering one
day alone in the fields is attacked by a brutal satyr.
He drags her into a cave, violates her and then makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
his escape. She faints, and on awakening imagines
that her assailant, who has disappeared as suddenly
as he came, was a being from another world: she
had seen him in the full sunlight; he is the sun-god
Apollo. She tells no one of her adventure, conceals
her condition and when her time comes, makes her
way alone to the same cave. The child is born,
wrapped by the girl mother in a piece of cloth,
and placed, together with a golden bracelet as token,
in a wicker basket. Then he is abandoned, and of
his fate we hear no more.</p>

<p>About the same time at Delphi, in one of those
periods of promiscuous sexual intercourse allowed
and encouraged by temple ritual, one of the Delphian
women becomes a mother, by a roving soldier of
fortune named Xuthus. The latter leaves Delphi,
ignorant of his paternity, and the woman is soon
after appointed priestess of the temple. Her child,
Ion, ostensibly a foundling, is reared within the
temple precinct and regards the priestess as
his foster mother. Meanwhile, the soldier Xuthus
makes his way to Athens and marries Creüsa.
They have no children, and come to Delphi to
ask advice of the oracle. The priestess recognises
Xuthus as the father of her son, and so arranges
matters—remaining herself unseen—that after a
conversation with the boy he acknowledges him as
his child, the result of the former hasty connexion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>But though Xuthus has now got a son, Creüsa is
still a childless wife. In passionate anger she reveals
her long hidden secret, denounces the god as the
author of her ruin, and with the help of a slave,
attempts to poison Ion. The plot fails, she is pursued
as a murderess by Ion and is on the point of
being put to death. Then the priestess once more
intervenes. She has heard Creüsa’s story—in some
details not unlike though more lamentable than her
own—and she determines to help a fellow sufferer.
She has already given up her son to his father, and
she now arranges a second trick whereby Creüsa
shall believe Ion to be her child. She has in her
possession a baby’s wicker cradle, a piece of cloth
similar to that in which the dead baby was wrapped,
and Creüsa’s own bracelet which has been used in
the poisoning plot. By an ingenious subterfuge
she makes all three appear to be the recognition
tokens of Creüsa’s child. Creüsa with joy, Ion with
some painful doubts, accept the new relationship;
and so the play ends.</p>

<p>The Ion and the Andromache both abound in
incident: the Medea and the Alcestis depend more
on a psychological interest. They are ‘one-part’
plays—the strong woman Medea and the weak man
Admetus—and they have many points of resemblance.
In the Medea a mother kills her children
to save her own pride: in the Alcestis a mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
consents to death to save her children’s position.
Alcestis is a saint: Medea—to some people—a
devil.</p>

<p>Medea is certainly not meant to be a pleasant
character. She has laboured too long under a sense
of injustice to be pleasant either in her thoughts
or behaviour. ‘You are always abusing the government;’
Jason says to her, ‘and so you will
have to be ejected.’ She expresses the revolt of
women in its bitterest form. ‘Of all things that
draw breath,’ she cries, ‘and have understanding,
we women are the most miserable; we are merely
<em>a thing that exists</em>. To begin with, we must outbid
each other to buy ourselves a lord and take a master
of our body. ’Tis a risky business—we may get
a knave or an honest man. To leave her husband
brings a woman no honour, and we may not refuse
our lords. When a woman comes to fresh ways
and pastures new, she needs must be a prophet, for
she has never been taught at home how best to use
the man who now shares her bed. If we work
our task aright, and our lord keeps house with us,
and does not kick against the yoke, then our life is
enviable. If not—better to be dead. A man, if he
is vexed with the company of his household, goes
out and purges away his heart’s annoyance; but
we women are compelled to look ever at one
soul.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>This isolation was the worst feature in a Greek
woman’s life: to a clever woman it was soul-destroying,
and Medea is incomparably cleverer than any
man in the play. The scenes where she forces the
two old men, ‘King’ Creon and ‘King’ Ægeus
to do, not what they want, but what she wants,
are masterpieces of satirical humour. With her
husband her cleverness fails her: she is too angry to
reason: she hisses her scorn and foams her disgust.
Jason keeps cool and so far has the best of the
argument.</p>

<p>‘You certainly are a clever woman,’ he says,
‘but you are only a woman. I am a very fine figure
of a man: you fell in love with me; and it was only
natural.’</p>

<p>Jason is in many ways like Admetus. Both are
lovers of outward show and have a great regard for
men’s opinion. Both say with some emphasis that
a family of two children is quite large enough.
Both have the same opinion of women; and this
is how Jason concludes—‘Men ought to be able to
get their children from some other source: the
female sex should not exist: and then there would
be no trouble for mankind.’</p>

<p>Such sentiments naturally fail to please either
the chorus or Medea. The comment of the chorus
is, ‘You have made the best of your case, but still,
surprising though it may seem to you, I think you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
are acting unfairly in betraying the woman who has
shared your bed.’ Medea gives full vent to her
anger: she contemptuously refuses the help in
money which Jason says he is ‘ready to give with
an ungrudging hand,’ and at last scornfully dismisses
him—‘Be off with you. You are yearning for the
new girl you have broken in, all the time that you
linger outside her house. Go and play the bridegroom
with her.’</p>

<p>But in the next scene Medea has mastered her
temper and pretends to submit. ‘We are but
what we are,’ she says, ‘just women. You must not
take pattern by the evil nor answer folly with
foolishness. I give way: I acknowledge that I
was wrong.’ Jason is patronising and friendly in
his answer: ‘I approve your present attitude, and,
indeed, I do not blame your past behaviour: it is
only to be expected: woman is a thing of moods.’
He consents to ask his new wife for a remission of the
children’s exile. ‘Certainly I will, and I fancy that
I shall persuade her.’ ‘Yes, indeed, you will,’
Medea says, ‘if she is one of us: all women are alike.
But I will help you once again in this enterprise, too.’
And as in the past she had given him an antidote
against the fire-breathing bulls, so now she gives
him the fiery robe which is to destroy the young
bride.</p>

<p>Then comes the crucial scene of the play: Medea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
kills her children and we are faced by the problem—when
is killing murder?</p>

<p>A mother who kills her child is to us a dreadful
figure, and the death penalty is invoked against the
deserted girl-mother: no punishment is inflicted
upon the father, perhaps because no punishment can
be adequate. Greek law and custom went further
and in a different direction. The father was allowed
to decide whether the child whom his wife had
brought forth should be reared. Child killing in
this fashion, when done by the father, was not a
crime, and the exposure of children after birth was
a common, and by no means held to be a reprehensible
act. Plato, indeed, thinks it a fit subject
for a jest in the Theætetus (p. 161). ‘Do you think,’
says Socrates, ‘that it is right in all cases to rear
your own child? Will you be very angry if we take
it—the argument—from you, as we might take a
baby from a young mother with her first child?’
‘Oh, no,’ answers the other. ‘Theætetus will not
mind: he is not at all hard to get on with.’</p>

<p>The mother who did mind was regarded as a
difficult person, but whether she minded or not,
decision lay with the father—as we see in Terence’s
play, The Self Tormentor. There the wife says to her
husband, ‘You remember, don’t you, when I was
pregnant, you told me emphatically that if the child
should be a girl you would refuse to rear it.’ The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
child proved to be a girl, and so without further
question it was got rid of. Male children were more
valuable, and unless the circumstances of their
birth were exceptional, as in the case of Paris and
Œdipus, they were not often exposed.</p>

<p>There is this further point: what differentiates
killing from murder is the question of risk. You
kill, you do not murder, when you risk your own
life. A soldier is not a murderer, and in sport
a fox-hunter is a man of different type from a pigeon
shooter. Now the Athenian women were not
Amazons, but they fought a battle no less dangerous.
‘They say of us,’ cries Medea, ‘that we live a life free
from danger within doors, while men are fighting like
heroes with the spear. But men are fools. Rather
would I stand three times in the battle line of shields
than bear one child.’ A mother had already risked
her life in bringing a child to birth; is she not far
more justified than the father in ending that child’s
life, if such be her will? Moreover, children are the
pledges of marriage, the securities given for a business
arrangement. Is it right that the party who wilfully
breaks the compact should retain possession
of the securities?</p>

<p>Such I believe are some of the questions that
Euripides meant to suggest. It is no answer to
them to say that it is an unnatural crime for a
mother to kill her children, for it is equally unnatural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and criminal for a father, and yet ancient fathers
killed their children without compunction and without
blame.</p>

<p>The Medea then is realistic and little else: the
Alcestis, the first in time of Euripides’ plays, is a
blend of style, and demands a fuller treatment.</p>

<p>There are no villains in the Alcestis, and there are
no heroes. There is one heroic character, but her
heroism is of so common a type that it usually passes
unnoticed. The three men, Admetus, Pheres and
Heracles, in varying degrees are animated by the
strongest of all male motives, self-preservation.
Alcestis lacks their sound common-sense; she is
guided by passion, by the strongest of all female
passions and that which comes nearest to the
divine, the maternal passion of self-sacrifice. She
has given life once, she is prepared to give it
again.</p>

<p>It is commonly assumed—and even Verrall tacitly
allows this to go unchallenged—that Alcestis ‘is in
love with’ Admetus, and Admetus ‘is in love with’
Alcestis. The affection which, happily for us, may
usually be expected to exist between husband and
wife, is taken for granted in the very different
conditions of Euripides’ time.</p>

<p>Now, as we have seen, this is a cardinal error.
Mutual affection and esteem did <em>not</em> reign in an ordinary
Athenian household. Husband and wife were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
usually indifferent one to another, and even this
indifference was an improvement upon the Ionian
relationship when husband and wife were often
natural enemies.</p>

<p>That a wife should give up her life out of love for
her husband is a state of things so agreeable to the
natural man that it is, perhaps, not surprising if
the language of the play has never been too closely
examined.</p>

<p><em>Alcestis’ motive is not love for her husband, but love
for her children.</em> Euripides, following Æschylus,
knew that maternal love is a far stronger force than
conjugal affection, even when the latter exists. The
mother and the children—on them he spends all
the resources of his unrivalled pathos—the husband
is a mark for his bitterest irony. It is because
Alcestis does not wish her children to be left <em>fatherless</em>
that she consents to death.</p>

<p>The position of the widow—as indeed, is implied
in our language by the form of the word—is definitely
worse than that of the widower. The orphan in
ancient times was the fatherless child, and the position
of the chief’s son whose father died in his
childhood was particularly unenviable. It is described
in two of the most pathetic passages in
Greek literature, by Andromache in the twenty-second
book of the Iliad and by Tecmessa, in the
most Euripidean of all the plays of Sophocles, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Ajax. Under the old tribal system, a chief’s power
depended very largely on personal ascendency, so
that old men like Laertes and Pheres found it expedient
to retire in favour of their grown-up son.
A small boy like Eumelus could not have maintained
his father’s position, and his father’s death would
probably have meant considerable danger to his
life. All this in Euripides’ time was a commonplace
and needed no emphasis. He prefers, indeed, to
deal with the reverse picture—the sorrows of the
motherless children and especially of the motherless
girl; for the pathos of the sacrifice is partly this.
It is for the sake of the boy and his future position
in life, and not so much for the girl, that the mother
dies.</p>

<p>Let us now examine the play itself. Admetus,
chief of Pheræ, has been told by his medicine man
that he is a very bad life: that, indeed, he cannot
hope to live much longer—three months, perhaps;
six months, say, at the most. But he has been a
generous benefactor to the profession, and in particular
has rendered some quite exceptional services
to the arch-physician, Apollo himself. Accordingly
a special provision is made in his case. If he can get
some one of his own family to transfer to him their
vitality, the operation may be feasible. The problem
is, to find the man—or woman—for his family is
very small. Admetus goes to his father and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
mother, but both, even his mother, refuse; for, as
we shall see, Admetus is not a very sympathetic
character, or likely to arouse the spirit of self-sacrifice
even in a mother’s heart. Finally he asks his young
wife, the mother of his two little children, and she
consents.</p>

<p>At this point the play opens. Admetus believes
what he is told; Alcestis believes what she is told:
the sixth month is ending and she is marked out for
death. So Death appears, and the burlesque dialogue
between Death and the Doctor, Thanatos and
Apollo, forms the prologue, where the arch-physician,
who can cure all diseases but one, is confronted by
that One himself. But the prologue and the entrance
of the chorus need not detain us. The first intimate
details about Alcestis are given by the servant
woman in her long speech to the chorus, and it will
be noticed that in the picture of the household
which she draws for them the central point is the
marriage bed. Twice already has Alcestis risked
her life upon that bed, and now another sacrifice
has to be made. A childless woman might refuse.
Her husband demands her life, and she must give
it for the sake of the children whom on that bed
she has borne. It is of her children that Alcestis
thinks: for them she prays: she has no petition to
make on her husband’s behalf. In all the narrative,
indeed, the husband scarcely appears. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
chorus—<em>of men</em>—notice the omission and enquire of him,
and this is the answer they get:</p>

<p>‘<em>Oh, yes he is weeping</em> as he holds the woman he
loves, his bed-fellow, in both arms. He is begging
her not to abandon him: <em>he wants what he cannot
have</em>.’</p>

<p>The chorus then burst into a lament which is
interrupted by the appearance of Alcestis and her
husband outside the house. The following scene
is an extreme example of that combination of pathos
and irony from which Euripides never shrinks.
The lamentation of Alcestis, expressed in lyrics
of the purest quality, is answered at regular
intervals by Admetus in iambic couplets where
style and thought alike are cruelly commonplace.</p>

<p>Then Alcestis who has been standing, supported
by her women, sinks to the ground and with one
last cry <em>to her children</em> thrice repeated seems to
faint away. Admetus in the name <em>of the children</em>
begs her not to forsake him ‘this is worse <em>for me</em>
than any death: on you we all depend—to live or
die.’ Alcestis makes her final effort, and for the
first time addresses her husband by name, but in the
pathetic speech that follows, her last words are
for her children, and it is plain that she is terribly
afraid that Admetus will marry again and inflict
a stepmother upon them. Admetus himself hesitates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to give the promise, and it is one of the chorus
who answers the dying wife.</p>

<p>With Alcestis disappears the pathos of the play.
The rest is ironical, a realistic criticism of the resurrection
story and hardly concerns us. But the
scene between Pheres and Admetus where the old
father—the mother is prudently omitted from the
action,—comes to convey his sympathy, is a beautiful
illustration of Euripides’ insight into the weakness
of the male character.</p>

<p>‘Such are the pair, father and son: behold your
ordinary sensual man,’ he seems to say. Dr. Verrall
spends some time and pains in showing that Admetus
is not a hero, and, doubtless, he is not heroic either
to us or to Euripides. But it does not follow that
an Athenian audience would share our or the master’s
private views. We are unconsciously influenced
by centuries of romantic literature in which the
relations of the sexes have been idealised. The
Athenians treated women much as the baser sort
still treat animals. To us Admetus seems almost
inconceivably selfish and callous: probably many
an Athenian never realised that his conduct was
reprehensible.</p>

<p>Even so to-day a vegetarian has considerable
difficulty in proving to the ordinary man that it
is unjustifiable selfishness to take life for the gratification
of appetite. ‘I always have eaten meat,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
such an one will say; ‘I always shall: and so did
my father. Animals were created for use.’ The
Athenian might have used the same language
about his wife.</p>

<p>But in the play itself no one is under any sort
of delusion as to Admetus. The servant woman,
the attendant, the chorus, Alcestis herself: all
know him for what he is, a selfish coward. Very
religious certainly he is and very hospitable: in
other words, very full of absurd superstitions and
very fond of having strangers in the house to divert
him from himself. Heracles the ravisher, and
Apollo the seducer, appreciate him as an excellent
boon companion: his own household do not share
their views. They know too well—and there is
constant reference to this in the play—that he is
‘foolish’ in the Euripidean sense of the word, the
slave of passions which he is unable to control.
And so we may leave him: in his character Euripides
explodes the fallacy that in all cases and in all
circumstances man is the superior animal.</p>

<p>But the wonder of the Alcestis is this: in spite
of the irony and cruel satire, in spite of the bitter
criticism of the two doctrines, the existence of the
supernatural and the superiority of man, there remain
so many other threads of interest—realism and
romance, pathos and humour—that a well-disposed
reader can shut his eyes to the unpleasant, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
usually does. What is wanted to bring out the full
meaning of Euripides’ plays is a double translation;
one version written in prose by a realist with a taste
for irony, the other composed by a lyric poet.
Neither version will be satisfactory apart, for the
spirit of Euripides is a compound of the two:
neither will be final, for translations quickly age and
Euripides is ever young.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX"><span class="smcap">IX.—The Socratic Circle</span></h2>

<p>Sophocles is almost the last representative of the
earlier and happier period of the Athenian Empire,
their golden age as it seemed later, when to the
complacent imagination of the male citizen all
things seemed to be working together in the direction
of progress and freedom. Progress indeed there
was, and for men freedom of thought, for the intellectual
atmosphere of Athens in the middle of the
fifth century B.C., with its combination of clear
knowledge and bracing speculation, has never been
surpassed. But as a society, Athens already
contained within herself the seeds of decay and
destruction. The wealth of her intellectual achievement
barely concealed the poverty of her social
morality, and it was only by dint of firmly closing
their eyes to the degradation of their women and the
misery of their slaves that the Athenians maintained
for a time the fond illusion that everything
was for the best in the best of all possible
cities.</p>

<p>Then came the shock of the Peloponnesian War
and the inherent weaknesses of a free State which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
refuses political freedom to more than half its
population were cruelly revealed. For nearly thirty
years, with some few breathing spaces, the struggle
went on, while Athens tried to force a culture
intellectually superior but morally inferior to that
of many other of the Greek peoples upon a reluctant
world: and in the end she failed and fell.</p>

<p>After the fifth century the political importance of
Athens disappears; her intellectual pre-eminence
is saved for her by a small group of men who under
the hard teaching of war discerned the flaws of
her social system and set themselves resolutely
to the task of criticism and reform. The nobility
of war, the nobility of birth, the nobility of sex:
these are some of the prejudged questions that the
Socratic Circle ventured to dispute, and their contentions,
as we have them recorded in the literature
of the late fifth and the early fourth centuries,
form perhaps the most valuable legacy that the
Greek mind has left us. But, like so much of Greek
thought, their ideas require interpretation for a
modern reader. Some of the greatest of the Circle,
Socrates and Antisthenes, for example, we only
know in the writings of other men, and we have to
disentangle the master’s ideas from those of his
disciples. Plato and Xenophon were drawn away
by metaphysics and soldiering, and social problems
form only a part of their interests. Euripides and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Aristophanes were compelled to conform to the
conventions of Attic tragedy and comedy, and we
must always discount the influence of the stage;
Euripides is often less and Aristophanes more
serious than suits our ideas of a tragic and a comic
writer. Lastly, for all the group except Xenophon,
irony was the favourite weapon of attack, an irony
so deftly veiled that it made the bitterest criticism
possible, and still often passes undetected.</p>

<p>But even so the critics were not popular and
their reforms were not accepted: Socrates was
put to death; Plato found a shelter in political
obscurity; Euripides, like Æschylus, passed much
of his life away from Athens; Xenophon took up
his home in the Peloponnese: in their lives they
fought against a stubborn majority, and when they
were dead the social organisation of Athenian life
remained apparently unchanged. But their teaching
lived on after them, and on feminist questions
it derives almost an additional value from the
general hostility of their fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>In their criticism of the problems that we call
feminism Euripides and Socrates were the initiative
forces, and a close study of the former’s plays is
indispensable for any one who wishes to understand
the position of women in Athenian life. But
the plays of Euripides throw also a certain light on
the position of Socrates himself. Socrates and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Euripides we know were close friends: ‘which of
the two gathered the sticks and which made the
faggot,’ so runs the ancient saying, ‘no man can
tell,’ and in many points of family relationship
they had the same experience. Euripides’ mother,
Cleito ‘the greengrocer,’ Socrates’ wife, Xanthippë
‘the scold,’ are two of the rare women in Athenian
history of whom we know even the names. Both
men were lovers of women in the nobler sense, and
the later misogynists revenged themselves by enlarging
upon their marital infelicities. In the case
of Euripides there is no real evidence to support
these scandals, and even if Xanthippë was a woman
of strong temper, both men were well enough satisfied
with the married state to take another wife in
addition to their first helpmate, when a special law,
rendered necessary by the waste of male lives in the
great war, gave formal sanction to such a step.
Both alike agreed in condemning the misogyny of
their day and knew that a man who habitually thinks
ill of women has probably no very good reason to
think well of himself. Both applied to women as
well as to men the great doctrines of liberty, equality,
fraternity.</p>

<p>Euripides saw in woman the equal and not the slave
of man, Socrates regarded her as his natural friend
and not his natural enemy. In Xenophon’s Socratic
books, the <cite>Memorabilia</cite>, the <cite>Œconomicus</cite>, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
<cite>Symposium</cite>, we get the best record of the master’s
view of the women, for Socrates was himself too
cautious ever to commit himself to the written word,
and perhaps the most characteristic of the episodes
is the visit to the fair hetaira, the one faithful
of all the lovers of Alcibiades, described in the
<cite>Memorabilia</cite>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There lived in Athens a fair lady called Theodotë,
whose habit it was to give her society to any one who
could woo and win her. One of the company made
mention of her to Socrates, remarking that the lady’s
beauty quite surpassed description. ‘Painters,’ said
he, ‘go to her house to paint her portrait, and she
displays to them all her perfection!’ ‘Well,’ said
Socrates, ‘manifestly, we too must go and see her.
It is impossible from mere hearsay to realise something
which surpasses description.’ Thereupon his informant:
‘Quick, then, and follow me.’</p>

<p>So off they went at once to Theodotë, and found her
at home, posing to a painter. When the painter had
finished, ‘Friends,’ said Socrates, ‘ought we to be more
grateful to Theodotë for displaying to us her beauty,
or she to us for having come to see her? I suppose
if this display is going to be more advantageous to her,
she ought to be grateful to us. But if it is we who
are going to make a profit from the sight, then we ought
to be grateful to her.’ ‘Very fairly put,’ said one, and
Socrates resumed, ‘The lady is profiting this moment
by the praise she receives from us, and when we spread
the tale abroad she will gain a further advantage. But,
as for ourselves we are beginning to have a desire to
touch what we have just now seen: when we are
going away we shall feel the smart, and after we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
gone we shall still long for her. So we may reasonably
say that it is we who are the servitors, and that she
accepts our service.’ Thereupon Theodotë: ‘Well,
if that is so, it would be only proper for me to thank
you for coming to see me.’ Afterwards Socrates
noticed that the lady herself was expensively arrayed,
and that her mother’s dress (for her mother was in the
room) and general appearance was by no means humble.
There were a number of comely maidens also in attendance,
showing little signs of neglect in their attire,
and in all respects the household was luxuriously
arranged.</p>

<p>‘Tell me, Theodotë,’ said he, ‘have you any land of
your own?’</p>

<p>‘I have not,’ she replied.</p>

<p>‘Well, then, I suppose your household brings you
in a good income.’</p>

<p>‘No, I have not a house.’</p>

<p>‘Have you a factory, then?’</p>

<p>‘No, not a factory either.’</p>

<p>‘How then do you get what you need?’</p>

<p>‘When I find a friend, and he is kind enough to help
me, then my livelihood is assured.’</p>

<p>‘By our lady, that is a fine thing to have. A flock
of friends is far better than a flock of sheep, or goats,
or oxen. But do you leave it to chance whether
friends are to wing their way towards you like flies,
or do you use some mechanical device?’</p>

<p>‘Why, how could I find any device in this matter?’</p>

<p>‘Surely, it would be much more appropriate for you
than for spiders. You know how they hunt for their
living. They weave gossamer webs, I believe, and
anything that comes their way they take for food.’</p>

<p>‘Do you advise me, then, to weave a hunting
net?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>‘No, no. You must not suppose that it is such a
simple matter to catch that noble animal, a lover.
Have you not noticed that even to catch such a humble
thing as a hare people use many devices? Knowing
that hares are night-feeders, they provide themselves
with night-dogs, and use them in the chase. Furthermore,
as the creatures run off at daybreak, they get
other dogs to scent them out and find which way
they go from their feeding ground to their forms.
Again, they are swift-footed, so that they can get away
in an open race, and a third class of dogs is provided
to catch them in their tracks. Lastly, inasmuch as
some escape even from the dogs, men set nets in their
runs, so that they may fall into the meshes and be
caught.’</p>

<p>‘But what sort of contrivance should I use in hunting
for lovers?’</p>

<p>‘A man, of course, to take the place of the dog;
some one able to track out and discover wealthy
amateurs for you; able also to find ways of getting
them into your nets.’</p>

<p>‘Nets, forsooth! What sort of nets have I?’</p>

<p>‘One you have certainly, close enfolding and well
constructed, your body. And within your body there
is your heart, which teaches you the looks that charm
and the words that please. It tells you to welcome
true friends with a smile, and to lock out overbearing
gallants; when your beloved is sick, to tend him with
anxious care; when he is prospering, to share his joy;
in fine, to surrender all your soul to a devout lover.
I am sure you know full well how to love. Love needs
a tender heart as well as soft arms. I am sure, too,
that you convince your lovers of your affection not
by mere phrases, but by acts of love.’</p>

<p>‘Nay, nay, I do not use any artificial devices.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well, it makes a great difference if you approach
a man in the natural and proper way. You will not
catch or keep a lover by force. He is a creature who
can only be captured and kept constant by kindness
and pleasure.’</p>

<p>‘That is true.’</p>

<p>‘You should only ask then of your well-wishers such
services as will cost them little to render, and you should
requite them with favours of the same sort. Thereby
you will secure their fervent and constant love, and they
will be your benefactors indeed. You will charm them
most if you never surrender except when they are sharp
set. You have noticed that the daintiest fare, if served
before a man wants it, is apt to seem insipid; while,
if he is already sated, it even produces a feeling of
nausea. Create a feeling of hunger before you serve
your banquet; then even humble food will appear
sweet.’</p>

<p>‘How can I create this hunger in my friends?’</p>

<p>‘First, never serve them when they are sated.
Never suggest it even. Wait until the feeling of repletion
has quite disappeared and they begin again to
be sharp set. Even then at first let your suggestions
be only of most modest conversation. Seem not to
wish to yield. Fly from them—and fly again; until
they feel the pinch of hunger. That is your moment.
The gift is the same as when a man desired it not;
but wondrous different now its value.’</p>

<p>Theodotë: ‘Why do you not join me in the hunt,
and help me to catch lovers?’</p>

<p>‘I will, certainly,’ said he, ‘if you can persuade me
to come.’</p>

<p>‘Nay, how can I do that?’</p>

<p>‘You must look yourself, and find a way if you want
me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Come to my house, then, often.’</p>

<p>Then Socrates, jesting at his own indifference to
business, replied:</p>

<p>‘It is no easy matter for me to take a holiday. I am
always kept busy by my private and public work.
Moreover, I have my lady friends, who will never let
me leave them night or day. They would always be
having me teach them love-charms and incantations.’</p>

<p>‘What, do you know that, too?’</p>

<p>‘Why, what else is the reason, think you, that Apollodorus
and Antisthenes never leave my side? Why
have Cebes and Simmias come all the way from Thebes
to stay with me? You may be quite sure that not
without love-charms and incantations and magic
wheels may this be brought about.’</p>

<p>‘Lend me your wheel, then, that I may use it on you.’</p>

<p>‘Nay, I do not want to be drawn to you. I want
you to come to me.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I will come. But be sure and be at home.’</p>

<p>‘I will be at home to you, unless there be some lady
with me who is dearer even than yourself.’</p>

</div>

<p>It is a significant incident, charmingly related by
Xenophon, but not altogether charming in itself,
although the humorous irony of Socrates may hide
from careless readers all the darker sides of the
picture. But Socrates himself is entirely lovable.
There is nothing furtive, nothing patronising in the
philosopher’s attitude. He behaves to Theodotë
as he would behave to every one. He admires her
beauty, and, like Goldsmith, recognises that a
beautiful woman is a benefactress to mankind.
But while he knows the strength of her position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
he realises its weakness also, and there is a shade
of pity in his admiration.</p>

<p>A similar appreciation of women is shown in many
passages of the <cite>Symposium</cite>; for example, when
Socrates says, ‘Women need no perfume: they
are compounds themselves of fragrance.’ There is
that Socratic paradox, also, after the dancing-girl’s
performance:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘This is one proof, among very many, that woman’s
nature is in no way inferior to man’s: she has no lack
either of judgment or physical strength.’</p>

</div>

<p>He continues his argument by advising his friends to
<em>teach</em> their wives; and he deals with the weakest
point in woman’s life—the ignorance in which they
were kept. ‘Do not be afraid,’ he says; ‘teach
her all that you would wish your companion to
know.’</p>

<p>Thereupon Anthisthenes puts the pertinent question:
‘If that is your idea, Socrates, why do you
not try and train Xanthippë, who is, I believe, the
most difficult of all wives, present, past, and future?’
To this he gets the following reply:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I have noticed,’ says Socrates, ‘that people who
wish to become good horsemen get a spirited horse,
not a tame, docile animal. They think that if they can
manage a fiery steed they will find no difficulty with
an ordinary horse. My case is the same. I wanted
to be a citizen of the world and to mix with all men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
So I took her. I am quite sure that if I can
endure her, I shall find no difficulty in ordinary
company.’</p>

</div>

<p>Thus Socrates draws benefit even from a shrewish
wife. His ideas of a happy marriage, and the best
means of securing that happiness, are set out for us
by Xenophon in the <cite>Œconomicus</cite>. Ischomachus,
Socrates’ interlocutor, is for all practical purposes
Xenophon himself, and the whole passage should
be compared with those delightful stories of conjugal
happiness—the tale of Panthea, and the wife of
Tigranes—which the historian gives us in the
Education of Cyrus. The dialogue begins by
Socrates asking Ischomachus how he won his sobriquet
of ‘honest gentleman’—surely not by staying
at home!</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘No,’ replies Ischomachus, ‘I do not spend my days
indoors: my wife is quite capable of managing our
household without my help.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, that is what I want to know. Did you train
your wife yourself to be all that a wife should be?
Or, when you took her from her parents, did she possess
enough knowledge to perform her share of house
management?’</p>

<p>‘Possess knowledge when I took her? Why, she
was not fifteen years old, and until then she had lived
under careful surveillance—to see and hear, and ask
as little as possible. All that she knew was how to
take wool and turn it into a dress. All that she had
seen was how the spinning-women have their daily
tasks assigned. As regards control of appetite, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
had certainly received a sound education, and that,
I think, is all-important.’</p>

</div>

<p>Ischomachus then proceeds to detail his system
of education. It begins with husband and wife
offering sacrifice together and praying that fortune
may aid in teaching and learning what is best for
both. Then, as soon as the wife ‘is tamed to the
hand, and not too frightened to take part in conversation,’
the husband explains that they are now
partners together, at present in the house, in future
in any children that may be born to them. They
have each contributed a portion to the common stock,
and must now work together in protecting their
joint interests. The wife agrees to this, but doubts
her own capacity. ‘Everything depends on you,’
she says; ‘my business, mother said, was to be
modest and temperate.’ The husband then explains
the true functions of man and woman and
their points of difference. Man has a greater capacity
than woman for enduring heat and cold, wayfaring
and route-marching. God meant for him outdoor
work. Woman has less capacity for bearing fatigue;
she is more affectionate, more timorous. God has
imposed upon her the indoor work. Finally, to
men and women alike in equal measure, God gives
memory, carefulness, and self-control. Custom
agrees with the divine ordinance. For a woman
to stay quiet at home, instead of roaming abroad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
is no disgrace: for a man to remain indoors is
discreditable. The wife is like the queen bee, on
whom all the work of the hive depends; and a
good mistress soon wins the loyal love of all her
servants. So the conversation proceeds, and with
this beautiful sentence the first conjugal lesson ends:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘But your sweetest joy will be to show yourself my
superior, and to make me your servant; then you need
not fear that as the years roll on you will lose your place
of honour in the house; you will be sure that, though
you are no longer young, your honour will increase;
even as you become a better partner to myself and the
children, and a better guardian of the home; for it is
not beauty, but virtue, that nurtures the growth of
a good name.’</p>

</div>

<p>But Ischomachus does not confine his teaching to
words. He explains to Socrates how once he asked
his wife for some household article which she could
not find, and how deeply she blushed at her heedless
ignorance. So he gives her a practical lesson in
household management by taking her over the house
and explaining the uses of the various rooms and
different utensils, expatiating the while on the
beauty of order—‘for a beauty like the cadence of
sweet music dwells even in pots and pans set out
in neat array.’ His wife profits by the lesson, and
henceforth everything is in its proper place.</p>

<p>He deals faithfully, too, with that most pardonable
of woman’s weaknesses, the desire to please, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
leads some ladies to attempt to improve upon nature.
So when one day he finds his wife with powder and
rouge upon her cheeks, and wearing high-heeled
shoes, he begins like this:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Dear wife, would you think me a good partner in our
business if I were to make a display of unreal wealth,
false money, and sham purples, wood coated with gold?’</p>

<p>‘Nay, surely not,’ she replies.</p>

<p>‘And as regards my body, would you hold me as
more lovable if I were to anoint myself with pigments
and paint my eyes?’</p>

<p>‘Nay, I would rather look into your eyes and see
them bright with health.’</p>

<p>‘Believe me, then, dear wife, I am not better pleased
with this white powder and red paint than I should be
with your natural hue.’</p>

</div>

<p>So after that day the young wife gives up cosmetics,
and on her husband’s advice takes healthy exercise
instead; the physical training he recommends being
‘to knead the dough and roll the paste; to shake the
coverlets and make the beds.’</p>

<p>With one last anecdote we must end. Socrates
asks his friend whether beside his practical wisdom
he has any rhetorical and judicial skill.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Of course I have,’ says Ischomachus. ‘I am
always hearing and debating cases in my own household.
Yes, and before to-day I have been taken on one side,
and have had to stand my trial, to see what punishment
I should bear and what fine I should pay.’</p>

<p>‘And how do you get on?’ says Socrates.</p>

<p>‘When I have the advantage of truth on my side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
well enough; but when I have not truth with me I
can never make the worse cause appear the better.’</p>

<p>‘And how is that? Who is the judge?’</p>

<p>‘<em>My wife.</em>’</p>

</div>

<p>Ischomachus’ home, at least, is no doll’s-house.
His wife is as far removed from the humble drudge
with whom the ordinary Athenian was familiar as
she is from the painted odalisque who to the Ionian
was the ideal of the perfect woman.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X"><span class="smcap">X.—Aristophanes</span></h2>

<p>The work of Aristophanes is a pendant to that of
Euripides, and is often inspired by a much more
serious purpose than is commonly supposed. Aristophanes
is no mere vulgar buffoon, and most of his
obscenity is an empty parade made necessary by
the conditions of the Attic stage which Aristophanes
himself in the course of his career rendered obsolete.
He was a member of the Socratic Circle (the famous
Symposium ends with Socrates expounding to
Agathon and Aristophanes the nature of tragedy
and comedy, and explaining the essential similarity of
their functions), and in his early manhood he fell
under the spell of the great tragedian. Of all his
comedies there is hardly one which in language,
music, and dramatic technique does not reveal the
intimate harmony that exists between the two men.
Aristophanes and Euripides, like our Shelley, were
born to be lyric poets, and they both possess the
divine gift of melody. But they were interested in
so many other things, in politics, in feminism, and
in social reform, that art with them often takes the
second place. As men they are incomparably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
greater than such self-centred poets as Sophocles;
as artists they neither aim at nor achieve his academic
perfection. Their methods are curiously alike, and
it is because Aristophanes knows Euripides so well,
and is in such intimate sympathy with him, that the
constant parody of the Euripidean style in the
comedies never becomes wearisome.</p>

<p>Parody, gross humour, indecency even, these were
the qualities that a comic poet at Athens had necessarily
to display, and Aristophanes, having chosen
his medium of expression, is compelled to obey the
restrictions of the comic stage. Moreover, it is
obvious that he enjoys indulging his humour to
the utmost. The wit of Euripides is restrained and
ironical, with something of the bitterness of old age;
Aristophanes in most of his plays has the exuberance
of youthful spirits and an overflowing stock of
fantastic inventions.</p>

<p>But a dramatist, even a comic dramatist, however
fantastic and inventive his humour may be, must
have some foundation of serious purpose, and that
foundation Aristophanes takes very largely from
Euripides. His three chief themes are the same as
those of the tragedian: firstly, that war is a curse—it
is useful perhaps for politicians and soldiers, but
only brings disaster to real workers; secondly, that
a belief in gods made in mortal shape is absurd—such
a belief will certainly lead to farcical situations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
which if treated realistically will be excellent material
for a comic poet; thirdly, that women are as capable,
intellectually and morally, as men—their experience
of house-management especially fits them for carrying
on the business of a State, and a feminist administration
might solve many problems that have proved
too hard for men. The first of these themes appears
in the plot of the <cite>Acharnians</cite>, the <cite>Peace</cite>, and the
<cite>Knights</cite>; the second in the <cite>Birds</cite>, the <cite>Frogs</cite>, and
the <cite>Plutus</cite>; the feminist plays are the <cite>Women at
the Festival</cite>, the <cite>Lysistrata</cite>, and the <cite>Women in
Assembly</cite>.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the treatment of these themes in
tragedy and comedy will be different; but the initial
point of view is very much the same. As for the
abuse of Euripides, and there is plenty in the
comedies, it is merely part of the comic game, and
it is foolish to take it seriously. Aristophanes,
Euripides, Plato, and Socrates were all close friends,
as intimate one with the other as are our leading
politicians, and to speak of Aristophanes ‘attacking’
Euripides and Socrates is to misread the situation.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that all the members of the
Socratic Circle thought alike on all subjects, and
even as regards feminism there are some points of
difference between Euripides and Aristophanes.
The comic poet is rather interested in the woman’s
cause than devoted to it, and in many of his plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
he certainly hesitates between the gross realism of
the phallic god and the new ideas of feminist doctrine.
Often, too, in his theatre women occupy as insignificant
a place as they did in the actual life of his
time. In the <cite>Wasps</cite>, for example, Philocleon’s
household apparently consists of his grown-up son
and the attendant slaves: nothing is said of wife
or daughter. In the <cite>Knights</cite>, ‘Demos’—John Bull—has
no Mrs. Bull to keep him company: his
domestic arrangements are in the hands of men
slaves. In the <cite>Clouds</cite> there is a vivid picture of
Socrates at home: house, furniture, and pupils
are all described, but nothing of Xanthippë. So in
the <cite>Acharnians</cite> and the <cite>Peace</cite> we have household
scenes, but no women take part in the action:
the women are there, but they are persons of no
importance. Trygæus, before setting off on his
adventurous voyage, bids an affectionate farewell
to his little children, but for his wife he has no
message. The Megarian sells his two daughters
for a handful of leeks and a measure of salt, and then
prays to all his saints that he may be lucky enough
to get as good a price for his mother and his wife.</p>

<p>A realist, depicting life at Athens in the fifth century,
was compelled to give women an insignificant
rôle, but even in this group of plays Aristophanes
makes one exception, the exception, perhaps, that
proves the rule, for even under the harem system the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
masterful woman will sometimes come to the front,
and Haroun al Raschid goes in fear of Zobeida. In
the <cite>Clouds</cite>, Strepsiades is married and by no means
independent of his wife: the lady is mentioned,
although she takes no part in the play, and the
reasons of this difference are instructive. Strepsiades
himself is a person of inferior social position,
lacking both in will-power and intellectual force;
his wife is a woman of property, the daughter of
a noble family and herself of determined character.
Using all these advantages, she is just able to hold
her own with her feeble, foolish husband, and to
insist at least on a compromise when their opinions
differ.</p>

<p>But it is possible to make too much of the absence
of women characters, for the conditions of performance
at the Lenæan festival were all against
feminine interests, and even though the plot of many
of the comedies has little to do with women, there
are constant flashes that reveal the author’s feminist
sympathies. Of all the episodes in the <cite>Birds</cite> there
is none quite so freshly humorous as the arrest of
Iris, the girl messenger of the Gods, and even in
the midst of the fierce political raillery of the <cite>Knights</cite>
there comes the delicious interlude of the lady
triremes meeting in council; the old stager
Nauphantë, addressing the assembly first and
revealing the goings-on of the Government, followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
by the shy young thing ‘who has never come near
men,’ and is determined to keep her independence,
‘heaven forfend, no man shall ever be my master.’
Indeed, considering the state of Athens and the
necessity that lay upon a comic poet of suiting the
tastes of his audience, the real surprise is that no
less than three of the remaining eleven plays—the
<cite>Lysistrata</cite>, the <cite>Women at the Festival</cite>, and the <cite>Women
in Assembly</cite>—should be concerned with the feminist
movement and be written in open advocacy of
the women’s cause.</p>

<p>The Women at the Festival—<cite>Thesmophoriazusæ</cite>—is
the lightest of the three, and is really a very
brilliantly written feminist ‘revue.’ Euripides is
the ‘compare,’ and in various disguises takes
part in most of the incidents. He has heard that
the women, now assembled in their own festival
to which no men are admitted, intend to have him
put to death, firstly for being a playwright and
secondly as a slanderer of womenkind. He goes
round to his friends to save him (the scene is a parody
on the <cite>Alcestis</cite>), and first of all to his fellow-dramatist,
Agathon. But Agathon, whose music is then
burlesqued, is too much like a woman to be of any
assistance. He is another of the inner Socratic
Circle, but in the way of jest the most infamous
conduct is imputed to him: his appearance is as
ambiguous as his morals, and all he can do for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Euripides is to lend him some articles of women’s
dress for the purpose of a disguise. So Euripides has
to fall back on his father-in-law, Mnesilochus, the
buffoon of the piece, and there follows one of those
scenes of disrobing with which we are familiar on
the modern stage. The old gentleman is undressed,
shaved all over and arrayed in woman’s garments,
i.e., he exchanges his rough white blanket for a
finer yellow one; winds a band-corset round his
breast and puts on a hair-net and bonnet. He is
now to all appearances a woman and goes to the
Thesmophorian Festival to find out the details
of the women’s proposal.</p>

<p>The women assemble, and in an elaborate burlesque
of a public meeting recount their grievances against
Euripides. It is because of the poet that men have
become so suspicious: they scent a lover everywhere,
spy on their wives, and lock up the store cupboards.
Old men who once would take young wives now
remain unmarried, for the poet has told them, ‘When
an old man marries a young wife, the lady is master.’
Finally, by his atheistical doctrines, Euripides has
ruined many an honest flower-girl, for men do not
offer garlands now to the gods. Then Mnesilochus
gets up for the defence. ‘I detest the fellow as
much as you do,’ he says; ‘but it is unreasonable
to be annoyed with him for talking about one or
two of our weaknesses—we have ten thousand which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
he has never mentioned.’ He then proceeds to
dilate on some of the frailties which Euripides
has omitted; but he is stopped by his angry
audience. ‘There is nothing so bad as a woman
who is naturally shameless’—the chorus say—‘<em>except
it be a woman</em>.’</p>

<p>A fierce discussion begins, until their arguments
are interrupted by the appearance of Cleisthenes,
one of those womanish men so unpleasantly familiar
in Athens, who tells the assembly that a real man is
among them. Suspicion at once falls on Mnesilochus;
he is discovered by plain evidence to be of the male
sex, and is seized by the women. He makes a gallant
attempt to escape by snatching a baby from a
woman’s lap, and holding it to ransom (a parody
on Euripides’ <cite>Telephus</cite>); but, when he unfastens
the child’s wrappings, it is not a baby, but a leather
skin, full of wine, which the lady has brought for
her private refreshment during the proceedings.
He then decides to send to Euripides for help, and
a parody of the <cite>Palamedes</cite> ends the first part of the
play.</p>

<p>The intermezzo, as we might call it, between the
two acts is a humorous statement of the women’s
case on strict Euripidean lines:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Each and every one [the chorus sings] abuses the
tribe of women: we are everything that is bad.
Well, then, <em>why do you marry us</em>? Why do you keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
us indoors, as though we were something very, very
precious? Why, if we peep out of a window, does
every man want to get a good view of our face? As
a matter of fact, women are better than men, not worse;
they are less greedy, less dishonest, less vulgar; lastly,
they alone are the <em>mothers</em> of heroes.</p>

</div>

<p>The second act is a series of attempts by Euripides
to rescue his defender. In the first episode the
tragedian appears disguised as the Menelaus of his
Helen. Old Mnesilochus is the fair but frail
queen, and the scene is <em>supposed</em> to change to Egypt.
But the women refuse to let their captive free, and
he is finally handed over to a north-country policeman,
an illiterate gentleman with a very strong
accent. On him Euripides tries the effect of another
tragedy. Disguised as Perseus he insists that
Mnesilochus is the captive maiden, Andromeda, and
that he has come to release her. But the policeman
proves obdurate. Then Euripides plays his last
card. Remembering that all policemen have a
<i lang="fr">faiblesse</i> for the weaker sex, he disguises himself
as an old woman, and comes in, leading by
the hand a young and attractive female. The
policeman begins at once to soften, and when the
plump flute-girl sits down on his knee he capitulates,
murmuring, ‘What a swaät toöng: it’s reaäl Attic
hoöney!’ A last vestige of professional caution
makes him ask the old lady her name. Euripides,
having to choose a title, chooses a good one, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
says, ‘Artemisia,’ which the policeman enters as
‘Artamouxia’ in his note-book, and then, handing
over the custody of his prisoner to the old lady
he retires indoors with his young acquaintance.
The other pair hasten to make their escape,
and the play ends with the policeman’s despairing
cry, ‘Artamouxia, Artamouxia, where are
you?’</p>

<p>The <cite>Lysistrata</cite>, ‘breaker up of armies,’ is a much
stronger play, and the heroine is a masterpiece of
dramatic characterisation. From the beginning of
the action, when she stands in the darkness waiting
for the women she has summoned, and frowning
with impatience—‘although a frown spoils her
looks,’ as her one companion tells her—until the
end, when, her purpose accomplished, she can say,
‘Let man stand by woman and woman by man.
Good luck to all, and pray God that we make no
more of these mistakes,’ she is a real living woman.
If Aristophanes had written nothing else, <cite>Lysistrata</cite>
shows that he understood the female mind almost
as well as Euripides himself: better far than most
women authors, except only the incomparable Jane,
to whose Emma in masterfulness and independence
the Athenian lady bears a close resemblance. The
plot of the play is simple. Under the lead of
Lysistrata the women of Athens make a league with
the women of Sparta, Bœotia, Corinth, and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Greek States (for the solidarity of women is one of
the key-notes of the play), to stop the war. For
this purpose they put into effect both active and
passive measures: they bind themselves by oath
to have no further intercourse with their husbands
until peace is made (the women at first object, but
under the lead of the athletic Spartan finally agree),
and they also seize the Acropolis with the treasury.
The old men left at home, and the officials, for most
of the men are at the war, try to use force; but
Lysistrata has marshalled and drilled her women.
In a very vivid scene the men attack, but, ‘Up
guards, and at them!’ cries Lysistrata; and the
forces of male law and order, as represented by
the Scythian policemen, are put to ignominious
flight. Then the men think it expedient to propose
a friendly meeting, and the ‘conversation’ between
Lysistrata and the Chief Commissioner is the most
instructive part of the play.</p>

<p>‘Why have you seized the treasury?’ he asks.
Lysistrata explains that all wars depend on financial
considerations, and that the women mean to stop
supplies. His argument, that women have no
administrative skill or financial knowledge, is
countered by the plain facts of home management.
‘It is not the same thing,’ says the Commissioner;
‘this is a war fund.’ Then Lysistrata declares that
the war has to stop—now, at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In our retiring modesty we have put up long enough
with what you men have been doing. You would
not let us speak, but we have not been at all satisfied
with you. <em>We</em> knew what was going on, although we
stay indoors. Over and over again we were told
of some new big mistake you had made. With pain
in our hearts we would put on a smile and ask, ‘What
have you done to-day about the peace?’ ‘But—what’s
that to you?’ our man would say. ‘Hold your
tongue.’ And so I did, then (says Lysistrata), but I
am not going to now. I have heard the strain quite
long enough, ‘Men must see to war’s alarms.’ This is
my version of the tune: ‘Women shall see to war’s
alarms’; and if you listen to my advice you will not
be troubled by war’s alarms any more. All you have
to do is to hold your tongue, as we used to do.</p>

</div>

<p>At this the Commissioner breaks in furiously:
‘You accursed baggage, I hold my tongue before
you! Why, you are wearing a veil now to hide
your face. May I die rather.’ But his anger does
him little good.</p>

<p>‘If that is your difficulty,’ says Lysistrata, ‘take
my veil’—and she puts it on his head—‘and now
hold your tongue; moreover, here is my wool-basket,
so you may munch beans and card the wool;
for now “Women, women never shall be slaves.”’
And so the scene ends with the triumphant chorus.</p>

<p>Between this, the first act, and the second there
is a short interval of time; and when we see Lysistrata
again she is having some difficulty in keeping
her women together and away from their husbands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
‘You long for your men,’ she says; ‘don’t you think
they are longing for you? I am sure they are
finding the nights very hard. Hold out, good
friends, and bear it for a little while longer.’ Her
arguments are successful, and soon the first man
comes in, with a baby in his arms, prepared to
submit to any terms. But till the peace is made,
no arrangement is possible and the poor husband
goes away unsatisfied. Finally, a joint deputation
of Spartans and Athenians appear before Lysistrata.
She, as a woman, and therefore, she says, a person
of sense, has no difficulty in arranging for them terms
of peace which are satisfactory to both sides; and
so the play ends with a ‘necklace’ dance, men and
women dancing hand in hand.</p>

<p>But this brief summary gives little idea of all the
devices of stage-craft in which the <cite>Lysistrata</cite> abounds.
It is eminently an acting play, and can still fill a
theatre. The language is certainly gross and its
heroine is entirely lacking in modest reticence, but
a glance at the French adaptation by M. Donnay,
of the Academy, and especially at the additional
episodes there introduced, will prove that grossness
is not the worst thing in the world, and that a quiet
tongue does not always mean a virtuous mind.</p>

<p>The Women in Assembly, <cite>Ecclesiazusæ</cite>, is much
less vigorous. Written twenty years later than
the <cite>Lysistrata</cite>, it shows plain signs of old age and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
failing powers. Euripides and Socrates have both
passed away; the Socratic Circle has broken up.
Tragedy is dead, and comedy is dying, for Aristophanes
has lost most of that ‘vis comica’ which
was his most wonderful possession. The influence
of Plato is substituted for the influence of Euripides,
and the play is a parody of feminist theories as they
are developed in the Republic.</p>

<p>The construction, however, is poor: the action
halts and changes midway in the play; the first
part is effective enough, but it would be more
effective if we did not remember the <cite>Lysistrata</cite>,
whose themes it repeats with less vigour.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the play Praxagora is waiting
in the darkness for the women she has summoned
to appear. They have resolved to disguise themselves
as men, and to attend the assembly which
has been called for that morning. There they are
to propose and carry a resolution that the State
shall be handed over to the management of women.
Presently they begin to assemble; their husbands
are safely in bed and asleep, for their wives have
taken measures that they should have a restful
night. Sticks, cloaks, shoes, and false beards are
produced and adjusted, but before they set out to
pack the assembly Praxagora proposes a rehearsal
of their arguments. The ladies who have confined
their attention to <em>looking</em> like men prove not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
expert at speaking in the male style, and Praxagora
herself has to give them a sample speech.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Things go wrong [she says] because we choose our
government on wrong principles. It is a government
by classes, and every one considers his own personal
interests. Public money is paid away for private gain.
A government of women would alter all this, for women
by experience in house management know how to get
full value for money. Secondly, women are conservative,
and would never agree to any violent change in
the finances or the tariff; they are natural economists,
and specious cries of fair trade would have no effect
upon them. Thirdly, as war ministers, they are certain
to be successful; their experience in providing meals
will ensure that the soldiers are well fed, and they are
not likely to risk unduly the lives of their own sons.
Lastly, women are so used to trickery that it will be
very hard to trick them. <em>Therefore</em>, without any further
talking or inquiry as to what women are likely to do,
the best thing is to entrust them with the government.</p>

</div>

<p>The women by the end of the speech have learnt
their parts, and with one last instruction to thrust
their elbows into the face of any policeman who tries
to interfere they all set out for the assembly. Then
Blepyrus, the elderly husband of Praxagora, appears,
and the play begins to deteriorate, for it is one of
the most dexterous touches in the <cite>Lysistrata</cite> that the
husbands are for the most part away from home, and
therefore can take no part in the action. Blepyrus
and his neighbours have found that their wives
have disappeared together with their cloaks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
shoes. While they are standing in doubt they hear
strange news. The assembly convened that morning
to consider the vital question of State reform is
already over; it was so well attended and so punctual
to time that many men came too late to vote or to
receive their attendance fee. A resolution has been
passed unanimously that tailors shall provide clothes
and bakers bread, free gratis to all; and, furthermore,
that the government shall be in the hands of
women. A good-looking young man, who made a
most effective speech, was chiefly responsible for
this change of policy. He pointed out that women
could keep a secret far better than men; that
they were in the habit of trusting one another, and
that they never would be likely to plot against the
government; moreover, everything but woman-government
had been tried already without much
success, and the experiment was well worth making.
Blepyrus and his friends acquiesce in the <i lang="fr">fait
accompli</i>, and when Praxagora returns she learns
from her husband that women are now in authority.
The socialistic State begins at once to take shape.
Praxagora decrees a community of property—land,
food, slaves, belong now to the State—every one
possesses everything. Women are part of the community
of goods, but to avoid disputes the less well-favoured
women and men are to have the first choice
of partners, and such unions are purely temporary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Law courts, gambling saloons, and night clubs are
all summarily closed; for these appurtenances of
civilisation are incompatible either with socialism
or feminism. The difficulty of work is disposed
of by the convenient institution of slavery, and a
<i lang="fr">régime</i> of universal happiness and feasting begins.</p>

<p>Thus far the first section of the play. The second
part, which is very inferior, attempts to show the
working of the new system. Praxagora disappears,
and the characters are mere mechanical figures.
A man, A; a man, B; a young man; a young
woman; three old women. The scenes are coarse
and uninteresting, nor is the prosiness of the dialogue
relieved by any of the vivid touches of humour
which mark the poet’s earlier plays. Finally,
this section, like the first, ends with a banquet,
given by the State, and open to all.</p>

<p>The <cite>Ecclesiazusæ</cite> is plainly inspired by Plato’s
theories of communism and feminism as we have
them now in the <cite>Republic</cite> and the <cite>Laws</cite>. A further
example of the connection between the comedian
and the philosopher is the Aristophanic tale of the
origin of sex in Plato’s Symposium. The story—a
Platonic myth with a difference—is so good a
specimen both of Aristophanes’ humour and of
the gay fashion in which the Greeks anticipate
modern science that it is a pity its length prevents
quotation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In ancient days [according to Aristophanes] there
were not two sexes but three, the children of the sun,
the earth, and the moon. Men were round in shape,
with four feet and hands, two faces, and they were
able both to walk and to roll. In the pride of their
strength they rebelled against heaven, and Zeus cut
them in twain. Apollo was bidden to heal the places,
but the two halves pined one for the other, and so in
pity the god turned their bodies round, and men became
in shape such as we see them now.</p>

</div>

<p>There are many other details, but the most striking
point in the story is the recognition of the original
identity of sex. The man and the woman are not
separate and opposite, but rather complementary
halves of one organism, which once included both;
they are a divided whole, and that is why men and
women yearn one for the other. How far the tale
is Aristophanes’ invention, how far Plato’s, cannot
be decided, but the doctrine of the identity of sex-qualification
is the common possession of all the
Socratic Circle, and forms as clearly the basis of
Plato’s serious philosophy as it does of the humorous
apologue of Aristophanes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI"><span class="smcap">XI.—Plato</span></h2>

<p>Plato differs from most of the Socratic Circle in
that he is, above all things, a visionary and a theorist.
He is essentially a masculine genius (with him we
hear nothing of wife and children), and he lacks
that grip of reality which the natural feminist,
Euripides, instinctively possesses. He regarded the
condition of society in his native city with a mixture
of dislike and contempt, and he saw that the main
cause of this condition was the indifference to women
and children which the ordinary Athenian prided
himself on displaying. In his feminism and his
educational reforms, Plato is deeply influenced by
Spartan teaching, but the main structure is his own
work, based not on any actual experience, but on
ideal theory. In this idealism lies both the strength
and weakness of his feminist doctrine. He refuses
to allow himself to be influenced, as Aristotle after
him was influenced, by the actual state of inferiority
to which Athenian women had been reduced; but
in forming a society which should be the opposite
of the degenerate Athens of his day, he is inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to disregard some of the invincible facts of human
nature.</p>

<p>Plato’s feminist doctrines are most clearly stated
in the fifth book of the <cite>Republic</cite> and the sixth,
seventh, and eighth books of the <cite>Laws</cite>. These works
are accessible to English readers (or, rather, their
rough substance is accessible, for we can never
reproduce the delicate music of Plato’s prose, and
his subtle irony evaporates in English) in Jowett’s
translation, and in the excellent version of the
<cite>Republic</cite> by Davies and Vaughan. But it may
be convenient to give a brief summary of his argument.</p>

<p>In the fifth book of the <cite>Republic</cite> the ideal State is
being discussed, and the rule κοινὰ τὰ τῶν φίλων (‘among
friends everything is common property’) has been
laid down. It has, moreover, been made applicable
to wives and children, for Plato at first hardly escapes
from the fallacy that a man’s wife is as much a
piece of property as a dog or a table. The organization
of the communistic <i lang="fr">régime</i> in detail then comes
up for consideration, but it is unanimously resolved
that the question of community of women is of
vital importance and must be explained at
once. The philosopher accordingly, with some
pretended reluctance, begins with a prayer
to Nemesis—‘I am on a slippery road,
and fear lest missing my footing I drag my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
friends down with me’—and thus approaches his
subject:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘The aim of our theory was, I believe, to make our
men, as it were, guardians of a flock?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Let us keep on the same track and give corresponding
rules for the propagation of the species, and for
rearing the young; and let us observe whether we
find them suitable or not.’</p>

<p>‘How do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘Thus. Do we think that the females of watch-dogs
ought to guard the flock along with the males, and hunt
with them, and share in all their other duties; or
that the females ought to stay at home, because they
are disabled by having to breed and rear the cubs,
while the males are to labour and be charged with all
the care of the flocks?’</p>

<p>‘We expect them to share in whatever is to be done;
only we treat the females as the weaker, and the males
as the stronger.’</p>

<p>‘Is it possible to use animals for the same work if
you do not give them the same training and education?’</p>

<p>‘It is not.’</p>

<p>‘If, then, we are to employ the women in the same
duties as the men, we must give them the same instructions?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘To the men we give music and gymnastic.’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Then we must train the women also in the same two
arts, giving them, besides, a military education and
treating them in the same way as the men.’</p>

</div>

<p>The professional humorist is then requested to
refrain from the obvious jokes suggested by the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of women stripped for exercise or old ladies practising
athletics, and to remember that all such things are
purely matters of custom. The real question is
whether the nature of the human female is such
as to enable her to share in all the employments
of the male, or whether she is wholly unequal to
any, or equal to some and not to others; and, if so,
to which class military service belongs. Women
certainly are different from men, but we must not
be misled by the word ‘different.’ A bald-headed
man is different from a long-haired man, but he may
be just as good a cobbler, or a statesman. So
women differ from men in the part they play in the
propagation of the species; but that difference
does not affect the question as to whether men and
women should engage in the same pursuits. The
argument of the adaptability of the sexes to various
occupations is discussed, and this point is reached:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I conclude then, my friend, that none of the occupations
which comprehend the ordering of a State
belong to woman as woman, nor yet to man as man;
but natural gifts are to be found here and there in
both sexes alike; and, so far as her nature is concerned,
the woman is admissible to all pursuits as well as the
man: though in all of them the woman is weaker
than the man.’</p>

<p>‘Precisely so.’</p>

<p>‘Shall we, then, appropriate all virtues to men and
none to women?’</p>

<p>‘How can we?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>‘On the contrary, we shall hold, I imagine, that one
woman may have talents for medicine, and another
be without them; and that one may be musical and
another unmusical?’</p>

<p>‘Undoubtedly.’</p>

<p>‘And shall we not also say, that one woman may have
qualifications for gymnastic exercises and for war,
and another be unwarlike and without a taste for
gymnastics?’</p>

<p>‘I think we shall.’</p>

<p>‘Again, may there not be a love of knowledge in one,
and a distaste for it in another? And may not one
be spirited, and another spiritless?’</p>

<p>‘True again.’</p>

<p>‘If that be so, there are some women who are fit, and
others who are unfit, for the office of guardians. For
were not those the qualities we selected, in the case of
men, as marking their fitness for that office?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, they were.’</p>

<p>‘Then, as far as the guardianship of a state is concerned,
there is no difference between the natures of
the man and of the woman, but only various degrees
of weakness and strength?’</p>

<p>‘Apparently there is none.’</p>

<p>‘Then we shall have to select duly qualified women
also to share in the life and official labours of the duly
qualified men; since we find that they are competent
to the work, and of kindred nature with the men.’</p>

</div>

<p>It seems to Plato that it is both practicable and
desirable that men and women should have the same
training and the same duties; not, indeed, all men
and all women, for Plato’s is an aristocratic State
and he is chiefly legislating for his guardian class,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
but at least the better men and the better women.
So he does not shrink from absolute similarity of
education:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Then the wives of our guardians must strip for their
exercises, inasmuch as they will put on virtue instead
of raiment, and must bear their part in war and the
other duties comprised in the guardianship of the
State, and must engage in no other occupations:
though of these tasks the lighter parts must be given
to the women rather than to the men, in consideration
of the weakness of their sex. But as for the man who
laughs at the idea of undressed women going through
gymnastic exercises, as a means of realising what is
most perfect, his ridicule is but ‘unripe fruit plucked
from the tree of wisdom’ and he knows not, to all appearance,
what he is laughing at or what he is doing:
for it is, and ever will be, a most excellent maxim, that
the useful is noble and the hurtful base.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus the first wave of the discussion is successfully
surmounted: the second and more dangerous is
the proposition that wives and children shall be held
in common. The company refuse to admit without
discussion that it is either desirable or practicable,
and a double line of argument is used. If men and
women are educated and live together, human nature
will soon bring about even closer associations.
Any irregular union would be an offence against
the State, and it is of the first importance to science
that the best citizens should have the largest number
of children. Therefore marriages and births must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
be a matter of State regulation, and any possible
discontent must be averted by an elaborate system
of pretence. The details are fixed:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘As fast as the children are born they will be received
by officers appointed for the purpose, whether men or
women, or both: for I presume that the State offices
also will be held in common both by men and women.’</p>

<p>‘They will.’</p>

<p>‘Well, these officers, I suppose, will take the children
of good parents and place them in the general nursery
under the charge of certain nurses, living apart in
a particular quarter of the city; while the issue of inferior
parents, and all imperfect children that are born
to the others, will be concealed, as is fitting, in some
mysterious and unknown hiding-place.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, if the breed of the guardians is to be kept pure.’</p>

<p>‘And will not these same officers have to superintend
the rearing of the children, bringing the mothers to
the nursery when their breasts are full, but taking
every precaution that no mother shall know her own
child, and providing other women that have milk, if
the mothers have not enough: and must they not
take care to limit the time during which the mothers
are to suckle the children, committing the task of
sitting up at night, and other troubles incident to
infancy, to nurses and attendants?’</p>

<p>‘You make child-bearing a very easy business for
the wives of the guardians.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and so it ought to be.’</p>

</div>

<p>The second argument may be briefly stated. In
the ideal State there will be no such thing as private
property: a man will not have a house or dogs of
his own, <em>therefore</em> (for our philosopher again seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
hardly to realise that the analogy between house
and wife is not quite exact), he will not have a wife
and children of his own. The whole subject concludes
with a return to the original topic of equality
of opportunity in these terms:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Then you concede the principle that the women are
to be put upon the same footing as the men, according
to our description, in education, in bearing children,
and in watching over the other citizens, and that
whether they remain at home or are sent into the field,
they are to share the duties of guardianship with the
men, and join with them in the chase like dogs, and
have everything in common with them so far as it is
at all possible, and that in so doing they will be following
the most desirable course and not violating the natural
relation which ought to govern the mutual fellowship
of the sexes?’</p>

<p>‘I do concede all this,’ he replied.</p>

<p>‘Then does it not remain for us,’ I proceeded, ‘to
determine whether this community can possibly subsist
among men as it can among other animals, and what
are the conditions of its possibility?’</p>

<p>‘You have anticipated me in a suggestion I was
about to make.’</p>

<p>‘As for their warlike operations, I suppose it is easy
to see how they will be conducted.’</p>

<p>‘How?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Why, both sexes will take the field together and they
will also carry with them such of their children as are
strong enough, in order that, like the children of all
other craftsmen, they may be spectators of those
occupations in which, when grown up, they will themselves
be engaged: and they will require them, besides
looking on, to act as servants and attendants in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
duties of war, and to wait upon their fathers and
mothers.’</p>

</div>

<p>It will be noticed that Plato does not shrink from
the question of military service for women. If a
man is unwilling or unable to defend his country,
he certainly has no claim to citizen rights, nor has
a woman. It may reasonably be argued that the
qualification for a vote is neither property nor sex,
but the proof that the individual has passed through
the period of training necessary to qualify him as a
defender of the fatherland. The qualities necessary
for a soldier are three: courage, strength, and skill.
No one acquainted with women can doubt that they
possess the first: in the passive courage which a
modern soldier chiefly needs it is possible that
women have a slight advantage over men, and they
usually recover more quickly from wounds. The
strength that is required in modern warfare is chiefly
endurance: the power to stand exposure to the
weather, insufficient food, lack of sleep and comfort;
marching capacity. No one who knows the vagabonds
and strollers of our English roads will say that
women are not capable of supporting all these hardships
as well as men. The female tramp is every
whit as sturdy and hardy as her male companion.
Finally, the skill to handle a gun and the power of
shooting straight are matters almost entirely of
training: the natural qualities, a steady hand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
a sharp eye, that help such a training are by no
means predominantly male characteristics.</p>

<p>Plato for his part is very insistent on this question,
and returns to it several times in the <cite>Laws</cite>. The
State is to maintain schools, where the art of war in
all its branches shall be taught to males and females
alike. Gymnastics and horsemanship are as suitable
to women as to men. Boys and girls together must
learn the use of the bow, the javelin, and the sling,
and in every well-ordered community at least one
day a month shall be set aside for warlike exercise,
in which men, women and children shall take part.
Female education will include a definite military
training: the girls will learn how to use their weapons
and to move about lightly in armour; the grown
woman will study evolutions and tactics. Finally,
in all public festivals and competitions the unmarried
girls shall compete with the youths in running and
in contests in armour.</p>

<p>It is on this point of military training, perhaps, that
Plato stands apart from modern sentiment: most
of his other ideals of feminine education are in process
of being realised, even that which allowed the
educated woman to become herself a teacher, and
rank with male colleagues. In the inner circle of
the Academy, the first University College of which
we know, men and women met on equal terms, and
shared responsibilities and privileges. The names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of two such women (neither of them, be it noted,
Athenians) are recorded for us by Dicæarchus and
Lastheneia of Mantinea and Axiothea of Phlius,
‘who even used to wear male attire,’ hold out their
hands across the centuries to Mrs. Bryant and Miss
Busk.</p>

<p>Plato, indeed, in spite of his idealism, is often
very practical, and on the question of marriage his
doctrine is most sound.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The simple law of marriage is this: A man <em>must</em>
marry before he is thirty-five; if not, he shall be fined
and lose all his privileges. Mankind are immortal
because they leave children behind them; and for a
man to deprive himself of immortality is impiety.
He who obeys the law shall be free and pay no fine;
but the disobedient shall pay a yearly fine, in order
that he may not imagine that his celibacy will bring
him ease or profit: moreover, he shall not share in
any of the honours which the State gives to the aged.</p>

</div>

<p>Marriage is to be regarded as a duty, and ‘every
man shall follow, not after the marriage which is
most pleasing to himself, but after that which is
most beneficial to the State.’ This cannot be effected
by definite regulations, but we should ‘try and charm
the spirits of men into believing’ that their children
are of more importance than themselves, and that a
child’s disposition will depend upon the happy
blending of its parents.</p>

<p>Plato realises that children are the State’s vital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
interest, and his concern for them extends to the
period before birth. Husband and wife are to consider
how they are to produce for the State the best
and fairest specimens of children which they can.
If proper attention is given to anything, success is
certain; and the eugenic system is to be under the
definite control of a committee of women, who shall
meet every day and spend a third part of the day in
ensuring that the regulations for perfect births are
duly carried out. Their care is to be expressly
extended to the future mothers, for the period of
a child’s life before birth is equally decisive, and the
young wife must be carefully tended, kept from
excessive pleasures or pains, and be encouraged
to cultivate habits of gentleness, benevolence, and
kindness.</p>

<p>Then comes the proper management of infants, and
Plato is very convinced of the importance of constant
motion for the young child, who in a Greek household
was often closely bandaged in swaddling clothes
and left to its own resources. He anticipates
Aristippus, who, holding that pleasure was the
chief end of life, found the best definition of pleasure
to be ‘a gentle motion,’ and he is prepared to make
his ideal state for infants at least a pleasant one.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The first principle in relation both to the body and
soul of very young children is that nursing and moving
about by day and night is good for them all, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the younger they are the more they will need it. Infants
should live, if it were possible, as if they were
always rocking at sea. Exercise and motion in the
earliest years greatly contribute to create a part of
virtue in the soul: the child’s virtue is cheerfulness,
and good nursing makes a gentle and a cheerful child.</p>

</div>

<p>This first period will last till the age of three, when
the child will begin to find out its own natural
modes of amusement in company with other children:
from three to six, boys and girls should live and
play together: after six they should separate, and
begin to receive instruction.</p>

<p>On the subject of co-education, which may be
regarded as the best practical solution for the cure of
sex-ignorance, Plato speaks with a rather uncertain
voice. His general theory presupposes an identity
of training, and the free mingling of boys and girls,
young men and women, in sport and work. But he
is disturbed by his conviction of the natural badness
of boys contrasted with girls:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Of all animals, the boy is the most unmanageable,
inasmuch as he has the fountain of reason in him not
yet regulated; he is the most insidious, sharp-witted,
and insubordinate of creatures; therefore he must be
bound with many bridles.</p>

</div>

<p>The further difficulty, that constant friendly intercourse
between young men and women may lead to
undesirable results is discussed at some length in the
<cite>Laws</cite>, p. 835, and the very sensible conclusion is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
arrived at that a healthy public opinion will be the
first result of these natural conditions of comradeship,
and that the general sentiment will be the
strongest of checks upon undue licence. The importance
of example in education and morals is rightly
insisted upon:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The best way of training the young is to train yourself
at the same time: not to admonish them, but to be
always carrying out your own admonitions in practice.</p>

</div>

<p>Finally, education is of supreme importance to a
country:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The minister of education is the most important
officer of State; of all appointments his is the greatest;
he will rule according to law, must be fifty years old,
and have children of his own, both boys and girls by
preference, at any rate one or the other.</p>

</div>

<p>These are some of the salient points of Plato’s
teaching, but a careful reading of the <cite>Republic</cite> and
the <cite>Laws</cite> will reveal many further issues and many
side-lights on the main thesis. Plato does not trouble
to be rigorously consistent, and, like Euripides, he
does not hesitate at times to play the part of the
candid friend, and to point out what he thinks
are the natural weaknesses of the female sex.
Sometimes he is right, sometimes he is wrong.
‘Women,’ he says, ‘are too prone to secrecy and
stealth; they are accustomed to creep into dark
places and resist being dragged into the light.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Plato seems to hit the truth. If there is one
quality—call it virtue or vice, as you will—which
is peculiarly a woman’s and not a man’s characteristic,
it is secretiveness. The result of many centuries
of self-suppression, it gives a certain aggravating
charm to the female mind, and usually does
no particular harm. But it is, perhaps, the chief
reason of women’s comparative failure in literature.
Sincerity in writing is the saving grace, and if a
book is not frank, it should never be written. Few
women authors resemble Sappho, or Jane Austen,
or Mme. Colette in contemporary French literature,
who, unlike though they are in the circumstances
of their lives, do all make a serious attempt at
truth. Most women fail in frankness towards
themselves and their readers. George Eliot, Ouida,
George Sand (to take another typical and strongly
differentiated trio) dissemble their facts as much
as they dissemble their names. Like ostriches,
they hide their faces under a cloud of words.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII"><span class="smcap">XII.—The Attic Orators</span></h2>

<p>To turn from Plato’s ideal State to the actual
condition of woman’s life during the fourth century
in Athens, as we have it revealed in the pages of
the orators, is like passing from a breezy hillside
into a dark, close-shut room. We see the working
of the harem system, with all its atmosphere of
secrecy and suspicion. The women are closely
watched; for it is presumed that they will be unfaithful
to their husbands if they can: they live
secluded in the women’s quarter of the house—the
gynæconitis—and for any strange man to
enter their rooms is a grave impropriety. In
Demosthenes, for example, we find it imputed to
Androtion, as a proof of unbearable insolence, that
in his capacity of tax-collector he forced his way
into the women’s apartments, and compelled the
master of the house to hide under the bed, putting
him thus to shame before his womankind. That a
wife should appear publicly with her husband at
a dinner party, and take a share in men’s pleasures,
is equally an offence against morality. Neæra was
known to have sat at dinner with her husband and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
his friends, and this fact, testified by witnesses,
is taken as an obvious proof that she was a woman
of abandoned character. The sister of Nicodemus,
Isæus argues, could not have been legally married,
for she was often seen at entertainments with the
man she called her husband, and ‘wedded wives
do not go out to dinner with their husbands, or
expect to join in festivities.’</p>

<p>The doctrine that a wife is her husband’s property
is applied to the fullest extent, and any offence
against that property is punished with the utmost
rigour of the law. A husband who finds another man
in his harem is allowed to put him to death. At
Athens there is no pretence of ‘the sanctity of marriage’:
the offence and the punishment is the same
whether the intrigue is with the master’s wife or
with his concubine: each is equally the master’s
property, to be protected at any cost. It is a more
heinous crime to make love to a woman who belongs
to another man than to offer her violence; for the
offence is viewed solely from the owner’s side, and
a woman who willingly yields to another is outraging
her lawful master’s <i lang="fr">amour propre</i> more
deeply than if she were taken by force. The lover
is put to death; the ravisher pays a fine: the
point of view being much the same as used to hold
in English law, where the wife-beater was regarded
as a less offensive character than the poacher.</p>

<p>But if the husband of an erring wife had the support
of the law, however violent his methods of
revenge, the case was very different when the woman
was the offended party. There is an anecdote in
Plutarch’s Life of Alcibiades which reveals the
attitude of the Athenian lawgivers.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Hipparete made a prudent and affectionate wife;—but
at last growing very uneasy at her husband’s
associating with such a number of courtesans, both
strangers and Athenians, she quitted his house and went
to her brother’s. Alcibiades went on with his debaucheries,
and gave himself no pain about his wife; but it was
necessary for her, in order to obtain a legal separation, to
give in a bill of divorce to the archon, and to appear personally
with it; for the sending of it by another hand
would not do. When she came to do this according
to law, Alcibiades rushed in, caught her in his arms,
and carried her through the market-place to his own
house, no one presuming to oppose him, or to take her
from him. From that time she remained with him
until her death, which happened not long after, when
Alcibiades was upon his voyage to Ephesus. Nor does
the violence used in this case seem to be contrary to
the laws either of society in general or of that republic
in particular. For the law of Athens, in requiring
her who wants to be divorced to appear publicly in
person, probably intended to give the husband an
opportunity to meet with her and to recover her.—<cite>Plutarch,
‘Alcibiades,’ Langhorne’s Translation.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>A wife seeking to escape from an unworthy husband,
we see, is regarded in the same light as a slave
seeking to escape from his owner, and all the resources<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of the law are put at the disposal of the husband and
the master. There was a constant tendency to think
of women and slaves together; and the institution
of slavery was certainly one of the most powerful
agents in the degradation of women at Athens.
A slave-girl was, in the eye of the law, a thing—not
a human being, and she was free from all restraints
of moral sanction. She was the property of her
owner, and her only duty was to obey him in all
things: virtue, chastity, modesty, were for her
things impossible of attainment; and over the
whole business was cast the protection and encouragement
of the law. There came into existence
a class of women condemned to physical and moral
degradation—a class whose very existence was an
insult to womankind; so that Aristophanes, at
least, has the wit to see that the establishment of
a female government would have as one of its first
results the forcible abolition of all such recognised
and legal forms of vice.</p>

<p>Women and slaves then were linked together; and
it must be remembered, as Professor Murray says,
that people do not become slaves by a legal process;
they become slaves when they are brought into
contact with superiors who have the power and the
will to use them as tools. There are three principal
tests of slavery, ancient or modern, and in ancient
life they will often apply equally well to women.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Firstly, slaves are a degraded and immoral class.
This was continually insisted upon; and doubtless
one result was to produce, in a certain degree, the
vices falsely imputed to nature.</p>

<p>Secondly, their work is despised, as unworthy of
free men. The harder work was left in the hands of
slaves or women, who did not receive any pay, and
the super-abundant leisure of the male citizen was
devoted to the political life.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the condition of dependence, once fully
established, soon produces a feeling of despair. The
willingness to die, which is so noticeable in Euripides’
heroines, is one of the sure signs of slavery. Slaves
are lacking in spirit; some, indeed, are so completely
lacking that they are happy in servitude: the
impetus to revolt must come from without, especially
when the servile state has existed for many centuries.</p>

<p>Slavery may be defined as the economic exploitation
of the weaker; and, though it does not exist in
our time and land, it offers such a convenient basis
for civilisation that various devices are used even
now to take its place. There is the theory, for
example, that some kinds of work are <em>higher</em> than
others, and therefore should be paid on a higher
scale. Or again, that the same work, if performed
by different persons, requires different remuneration.</p>

<p>Many estimates of women’s inferiority have
ultimately an economic basis. The more lucrative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
trades and professions are those for which it is
considered that women are temperamentally unfit.</p>

<p>It is a noticeable fact that all these general conceptions
of women’s weakness have always been
closely connected with their legal status. In Athens,
where women could not hold property, and an heiress
was taken over by the nearest male relative as a
necessary encumbrance on the estate, the estimate of
woman’s character was very low. In Alexandria
and at Rome, where women by various devices
outwitted the law and became possessed of some
degree of economic independence, their moral
position also changed for the better. In England
feminism begins with the Married Women’s Property
Act.</p>

<p>But as long as slavery, social or economic, is not
recognised by the law, it cannot be the curse that it
was to ancient life. In Athens it was a legal institution,
owing its validity to much the same mode of
thought as made the wife also her husband’s chattel.
It is the business of lawyers to defend the law, and,
if the law is bad, their moral sense is necessarily
warped in the process; so that it is not surprising
if the private speeches of the Attic orators, although
they exhibit the natural subtlety of the Athenians
in a striking light, by no means give an equally
strong impression of moral rectitude. All the
orators are the same in this respect. Demosthenes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
in matters of State was a high-minded patriot; as
a lawyer he is, like the rest of his colleagues, a professional
liar, and does not scruple to falsify and
misrepresent the truth. Lysias so forgets the man
in the advocate that he seems to reserve his highest
powers for his worst cases, and obviously delights
in such a client as the shameless old cripple for
whom he writes his most ingenious speech. Isæus
has no regard for veracity, and it has been found
by painful experience that his unsupported statements,
even on simple questions of fact, are, to put
it mildly, extremely unreliable. As for Hyperides,
he is careless of shame so long as he wins his case;
and his gesture, as he bids his fair client display
her charms, is like the calculated boldness of the
slave-dealer offering his girls to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>But if the orators give us an impression of cunning
subtlety which far transcends the bounds that we
even now allow to lawyers, their clients are in no
better case. By the middle of the fourth century
Athens was in full decadence. Her men had lost
all the vigour and courage that brought their
country safe through the dangers of the Persian
Wars: her women, perhaps, were even worse than
the men—<i lang="la">corruptio optimi pessima</i>—and had sunk
into a state of utter degradation.</p>

<p>Impotent old men and designing young women
are the chief figures in most of Isæus’ speeches; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
as his editor says, to have any confidence in the
veracity or virtue of his clients argues a truly
Arcadian simplicity. There is the case of Euctemon,
for example—the old man who divorces his wife
and leaves his children, to live with his slave-woman,
Alce. This unfortunate, whose youth has been
degraded for her master’s profit, has her revenge
when the old man grows senile. She induces him
to remove her from the den of infamy which has been
one of the sources of his wealth, to live with her in
the drinking-shop over which she is put in charge,
and finally to recognise one of her bastards as his
own son. The family, threatened by a second marriage,
reluctantly consent to help in an adoption
which ran counter to the first principles of Attic
law; and it is not until the old man’s death, when
his property falls into dispute, that his ‘misfortunes’
with the woman (so the advocate euphemistically
describes them) come to light. The facts of the
case are utterly sordid; but every detail is enveloped
by Isæus in a cloud of sophistical arguments which
show both a complete absence of moral sense in
the advocate and so great a faculty of deception that
modern writers have inferred—it need not be said
with how little reason—that polygamy was not
illegal at Athens, that concubinage was recognised
by law, and that bastards had the rights of legitimate
children. All three statements are untrue; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
they may fairly be deduced from the ever-shifting
arguments that the lawyer uses. In another of his
cases it is an old man at death’s door who marries
a young girl, and the usual imputations upon the
bride’s motives form one of his strongest arguments.
In a third, the estate of Pyrrhus, a woman of notoriously
bad life is foisted by her brother upon one of
her old lovers, and the claim is then made that she
is his legal wife.</p>

<p>But to go through the details of Isæus’ cases
would be merely tedious. In all of them we see
that moral degradation and absence of social
rectitude which was the natural result of the inferiority
of women in the eyes of the Attic law.
Women, like children, cannot legally enter into a
contract, even if it is only to purchase a bushel of
corn; the son of a brother has a stronger claim to
an intestate property than the son of a daughter,
for the law says, ‘males must prevail’; a daughter
cannot inherit in her own person; she is only an
intermediary by whom the estate is transmitted
through marriage to a male of the same blood as
her father. A woman’s disabilities are painfully
plain in Isæus: as for her legal rights, it is hard
to discover from his speeches how far they have any
actual existence. The orator, at least, when his
male clients seem to have the law against them, does
not hesitate to appeal to the natural sympathies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the male jurymen; and in the tenth oration we see
how shamefully an heiress, in spite of the law’s
formal protection, could be despoiled by her guardian
and her brother.</p>

<p>It is generally assumed that this male superiority
before the law had a religious sanction, the necessity
of keeping up the family worship, which could only
be done by a man. If we were speaking of a primitive
society the argument would have some force,
but the Athenians of the fourth century were at
the end rather than the beginning of their national
life: religion was dead, and the foundations of
morality undermined; only the law remained unaltered,
that women were the inferior sex. How far
women contributed themselves to their degradation
may be studied in all the orators’ speeches, but two
cases are especially significant: Antiphon’s murder
speech ‘Against the stepmother,’ and Lysias’
‘Defence for the murder of Eratosthenes.’</p>

<p>The first is grimly horrible in its sordid realism;
as Antiphon says, it is the story of Clytemnestra
repeated, but divested now of all its tragic romance.
Two women are the chief characters: one a free-born
Athenian, the wife of the murdered man; the other
a slave, the mistress of the man’s friend, one Philoneos.
The facts are these: Philoneos gets tired
of his mistress’ devotion, and determines to rid himself
of her by the simple process of selling her into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
life of utter degradation. He reveals his intention
to his friend, and the two men decide to have one
last carouse, the girl waiting upon them, before
she goes to her ruin. But the man’s wife, who has
found her husband as false to her as Philoneos is
to his lover, intervenes. She makes the acquaintance
of the slave-girl, who is still passionately devoted to
her worthless master, and persuades her to regain
his affection by a love-potion which she will provide.
The girl agrees, and when the two men meet at
dinner she pours the potion (which, unknown to her,
is a deadly poison) into their cups, giving the larger
share to her own false lord. Philoneos falls dead immediately;
the other man collapses, and dies some
days afterwards. The slave-girl is taken and broken
on the wheel; the wife is in this speech accused
by her stepson of her share in the crime.</p>

<p>Antiphon’s pleadings throw a lurid light on the
relations between men and women in a slave State;
the speech of Lysias in defence of Eratosthenes’
murder is an even more invaluable document. The
orator’s client is accused of murder, and relies for
his defence on the plea that his victim was taken in
adultery, and therefore lawfully put to death. The
law, at Athens a written, not an unwritten code, is
definitely on the accused man’s side; but it is curious
that this is the only surviving speech in which it
is pleaded as an excuse. It seems, indeed, that even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the Athenians hesitated to use the ferocious power
that the law gave them; and we may imagine, if
we will, that this was a test case, brought, perhaps,
by one of the Socratic circle, to try the validity of
the law in the face of the new feminist doctrines.
In any event, the Ionian Lysias, whose honeyed
pen was at the service of the highest bidder, was
a person thoroughly distasteful to Plato and his
friends, and it is probable that in this speech he had
the satisfaction both of defending the established
order of social morality, and also of striking a shrewd
blow at his personal enemies. The speech, which
is a model of art, begins with some compliments to
the jury, and then Lysias, very ingeniously, makes
his client tell the simple story of his life.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When I decided to marry, gentlemen, and brought
a wife into my house, I made this my rule of behaviour.
I did not annoy her with excessive vigilance, but on
the other hand, I did not leave her too much her own
mistress to do whatever she pleased. I kept as close
a guard over her as was possible and took all reasonable
care.</p>

</div>

<p>(This to conciliate the jury and to show that the
damage done was not due to any lack of precautions
on the owner’s side.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>After a time a child was born and then I began to
feel confidence, and handed over to her the charge of
all my goods, thinking that this was the surest bond of
union between us. At first, gentlemen, she was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
best of women, a clever housewife and a thrifty, exact
in all her management. Then my mother died, and her
death has been the cause of all my troubles. My wife
went to her funeral; that fellow saw her walking in
the funeral procession, and after a time succeeded
in corrupting her.</p>

</div>

<p>(The jury are meant to draw the inference that
women should never leave the house: one appearance
in public may mean ruin.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He watched my wife’s maid who goes to do the marketing,
made a proposal to her, and soon effected his
purpose of seduction. I must tell you, gentlemen, that
my humble home is built in two storeys, the upper
part similar in style to the ground floor, one containing
the women’s apartments, the other the men’s rooms.
Now when our baby was born, the mother began by
nursing it herself, and to avoid any risk of her coming
down stairs at bath-time, I took up my quarters in the
upper rooms, and the women came down to the ground
floor. Moreover, we soon got into the way of my wife
leaving me to go and sleep with the baby downstairs,
so that she might give him the breast and prevent him
crying.</p>

</div>

<p>(It is, of course, essential that the master’s rest at
night should not be disturbed, and the jury will
agree that this was a legitimate reason for a wife’s
absence from her proper place.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This went on for a long time and I never suspected
anything. Such an arrant simpleton was I that I
thought <em>my</em> wife the most virtuous woman in Athens.
Well, gentlemen, time passed away, and one day
I came back home unexpectedly from the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
After dinner the baby began to cry and make itself
unpleasant: the maid was hurting it on purpose to
cause a disturbance, as I heard afterwards, for the
fellow was in the house. I told my wife to go and
give it the breast to stop it crying, but at first she
would not go: she pretended that she was so delighted
to see me after my long absence. Finally, when I
began to get angry and bade her be off, ‘Oh, yes,’
she said, ‘you want to stay here and make love to the
parlourmaid; I caught you pulling her about the
other day when you were drunk.’ At that I smiled,
and she got up and went away, pulling the door to in
pretended jest, and taking away the key. I did not
think anything of it, nor had I any suspicions: indeed,
I soon fell asleep, for I had just come from the country
and was glad to get rest. It was getting on for daybreak
when she returned and opened the door. I
asked her then why the doors had been banging in the
night, and she pretended that the child’s lamp had
blown out, and she had gone next door to get a light.
I said nothing and believed her tale. I did, however,
notice that her face was covered with powder—although
her brother had not been dead a month—but still I
said nothing about her conduct. I went out and left
the house in silence.</p>

</div>

<p>(White cheeks were highly esteemed at Athens,
and when a lady wished to be especially attractive,
she procured them artificially. In this case the husband
is distracted by a double feeling: gratification
at his wife’s apparent desire to please him, and disgust
at her obvious disrespect for a male relative.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Some time elapsed after these events, gentlemen, and
I had no inkling of my misfortune, when one day an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
old person came up to me. She was sent, as I heard
afterwards, by another woman that fellow had seduced
and then abandoned, who, in her rage and indignation
had spied on him until she found out the reason of his
desertion. Well, the old lady came to me near my
house, where she was watching, and ‘Euphiletus,’ said
she, ‘don’t think that I have come in any spirit of
officious interference: the man who is wronging you
and your wife, as it happens, is an enemy of mine. If
you take the maid who goes to market and does your
errands, and torture her, you will find out everything.
The man is Eratosthenes, of Oea: he is responsible
for this; he has seduced your wife and many other
women besides: that is his trade.</p>

</div>

<p>So the warning comes, and then events move
quickly. The husband takes the servant, and by
a mixture of promises and threats compels her not
only to confess, but to betray her mistress. When
next the lover comes to the house—it is alleged
by the prosecution that he is beguiled there by the
husband, and although this is denied, it is regarded
as a quite legitimate plot—the maid informs her
master; witnesses are hastily summoned; the door,
left unfastened by the girl, is pushed open and the
guilty pair are discovered together. Eratosthenes
is struck down, his arms are pinioned, and then
in the name of the law and in cold blood he is killed.
The scene is like the last act of <cite>Scheherazade</cite> without
its barbaric magnificence. Of the woman nothing
is said, and the speaker concludes by reminding his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
judges that his cause is theirs, and that the only way
to prevent illicit love is to take summary vengeance
on the lover.</p>

<p>The point of view, it will be noticed, as regards the
marriage relationship, is very different from that
expressed by Plato or Aristotle. Plato regards
marriage as a temporary connection dictated by
mutual interest and dissolvable at will. Aristotle
says (<cite>Politics</cite>, 7, 16):</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As to adultery, let it be held disgraceful for any man
or woman to be unfaithful when they are man and wife.
If during the time of bearing children anything of the
sort occur, let the guilty person be punished with a
loss of privileges in proportion to the offence.</p>

</div>

<p>The philosophers see that marital fidelity is important
chiefly in relation to children and the State,
and they attach the same stigma to either of the
parties who break the contract. Lysias, as a lawyer,
suiting his arguments to a male audience, takes much
lower ground. The husband smiles at his own
infidelities, but claims the right to commit murder
when his wife retaliates.</p>

<p>The <cite>Eratosthenes</cite> is, perhaps, the most vivid picture
we have of home-life in Athens, but the general
impression given by all the orators is much
the same. Women are either cowed into hopeless
submission or else they are shamelessly profligate.
The occasional exceptions, such as we find in Lysias’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
speech ‘Against Diogiton,’ where a widow defends
her children’s interests with skill and vigour, show
that the fault was due to the marriage system
rather than to woman’s nature. Most of the women,
however, are incapable of energy: their prison life
has deprived them of the power and will to act. In
Lysias’ speech ‘Against Simon,’ for example, the
speaker, a bachelor living in an abominable relationship,
has his sister and nieces as inmates of his house,
and he says: ‘These ladies’ life has been so decent
and orderly that they are ashamed even for the men
of their own household to set eyes upon them.’
In Demosthenes’ speech ‘Against Conon,’ his unfortunate
client, again a bachelor, has his mother
keeping house for him. When, after his encounter
with the ‘Fighting Cocks’ Club’ he is carried home,
his cloak stolen, his lip split, and both eyes closed,
the ladies of his establishment, his mother and his
female attendants, begin to weep and wail over his
sad condition—but they do nothing else. His male
acquaintances carry him off to the public bath, there
fetch a doctor, and finally remove him to the house of
a friend. Even as ministering angels the Athenian
women seem to have been ineffective. Only in the
case of the imprisonment or the death of their male
relatives do they come actively forward, and the
business of mourning and funeral lamentation was
by convention left almost entirely in their hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the Athenian women then, as we see them
in the writings of the orators, are mere passive
animals; a few, and by no means the least successful,
are open in their profligacy. Such an one
is the mother of Æschines, as we have her described
by Demosthenes in the speech ‘On the Crown’;
such also the abominable pair, mother and daughter,
who are the chief characters in the speech ‘Against
Neæra,’ which is attributed to Demosthenes. Here
the mother, Neæra, a woman of notoriously bad
character, succeeds in marrying an Athenian citizen,
and her daughter Phanô, a person as vicious as
herself, by one of those strange turns of fortune
only possible in a real democracy, becomes the wife
of the King-Archon, the head of the State religion,
as we might say, wife of the Archbishop of
Canterbury. Such another, finally, is the fair
Antigona in Hyperides’ speech ‘Against Athenogenas,’
a lady who combined the professions of
broker and courtesan, and was equally successful
in both.</p>

<p>Of women who were both virtuous and capable
the orators tell us singularly little, and the probable
reason is that such women in Athens had almost
ceased to exist. Demosthenes and his contemporaries
represent the last stage, when their country
was already on the brink of political extinction, and
the men of Athens had no ideals or examples of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
womanly virtue to encourage them in their vain
struggle against the great military power of the North.
The lack of good women was a fatal disaster, but
it was a disaster which the Athenians had brought
upon themselves, and it led them straight to ruin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII"><span class="smcap">XIII.—Aristotle</span></h2>

<p>As the political life of Athens ends with Demosthenes,
so the creative force of the Greek genius
ceases with Aristotle. There are some brilliant
and many charming writers after his time, but they
rely for all the originality of their thought on their
great predecessors. Aristotle is the last of the
creators: ‘<i lang="fr">tout le reste, c’est littérature</i>.’</p>

<p>Hence his unique importance in the history of
human thought: not merely is he, perhaps, the
greatest mind that Greece produced, but he has the
advantage of coming last in the long line of thinkers
on whom nearly all our intellectual life even now
depends. In every department of civilised existence
the influence of Aristotle must still be taken into
account, and his judgment of women’s position in
society—a view sincerely held and on the whole
most temperately expressed—has had far more
effect on the world than have the idealist theories
of Plato. His statement of the moral disabilities
of women is to be found best in the <cite>Ethics</cite>; of their
social disabilities in the treatise <cite>On Generation</cite>.
The following quotations are from the English translations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of those works by Welldon, Jowett, and
Platt.</p>

<p>To begin with the moral situation in the <cite>Ethics</cite>.
Aristotle several times repeats the statement, common
enough in ancient literature, though it seems
now open to serious objection, that women are less
temperate and continent in their desires than men.
He does not blame them, but rather regards them
with pity, ‘for a woman is naturally in such matters
weaker than a man: a man’s love is passionate and
open; women feel desire and are cunning.’<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> A
line from <cite>The Beguiling of Zeus</cite> is quoted to support
this view by the authority of Homer, and the philosopher
himself agrees with the common Greek view
that for a woman to wish to keep her husband to
herself was a proof that she was both unreasonable
and lascivious. So, in discussing certain morbid
habits, such as the practice of biting one’s nails
or eating cinders, Aristotle has the significant remark:
‘Now whenever nature is the cause of these habits
nobody would call people who give way to them
incontinent, any more than we should call women
incontinent from being not males but females.’<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It
is, perhaps, this belief in the natural incapacity
of women for virtue that is the cause of the depreciatory
remarks concerning the essential excellence
of an Athenian woman, ‘bashful modesty.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It would not be right to speak of a sense of shame
as a virtue, for it is more like an emotion than a moral
state: at least it may be defined as a kind of fear of
ignominy, and in its effects it is analogous to the fear
of dangers, for people blush when they are ashamed and
turn pale when they are afraid of death. It is clear,
then, that both affections are in a sense corporeal, and
this seems to be the mark of an emotion rather than
a moral state.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Other slighter defects in the female character, as
conceived by Aristotle, are hinted at in the remark:
‘It is only exceedingly slavish people who eat and
drink beyond the point of surfeit’; and in the
well-known description of the ‘Magnanimous Man,’
Aristotle’s ideal, who, unlike the shrill-voiced woman,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">will have a deep voice and a sedate manner of speaking
and be slow in his movements: he will not be in a hurry
or emphatic in speech, for there are not many things
he cares for, nor does he regard anything as very important,
and these are the causes which make people
speak in shrill tones and use rapid movements.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These are some of the deficiencies in women:
we have to go to the <cite>Rhetoric</cite> to get Aristotle’s idea
of their merits. The passage is significant:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>θηλειῶν δὲ ἀρετή σώματος μὲν κάλλος καὶ μέγεθος, ψύχης δὲ
σωφροσύνη καὶ φιλεργία ἄνευ ἀνελευθερίας.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The excellence of females is (<i>a</i>) physical, a large and
beautiful body; (<i>b</i>) mental, virtuous moderation and
a love—but not a sordid love—of work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>First, it will be seen, comes physical attractiveness.
The excellent woman must be good-looking,
and by ‘good-looking’ we mean tall and stout,
for ethereal grace does not suit the harem-master’s
taste. Secondly, she will be temperate in her desires:
the word ‘Sophrosyne,’ ‘virtuous moderation,’ is
the chief virtue in a woman: it is the faculty of
‘doing without’—love, food, pleasure, consideration,
etc.—and the Greeks, unlike the Romans,
really did admire this passive merit even in men.
Thirdly comes industry, with the restriction that a
woman must not be a slave to work: she has other
even more important duties—her master’s pleasure,
for example—and work must not be allowed to
interfere unduly. In his conception of female
virtue Aristotle has advanced somewhat from
Pericles’ negative ideal, but he has not got very far.</p>

<p>The most instructive passages, however, in the
<cite>Ethics</cite> are in the Eighth Book, where friendship is
considered.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There is another kind of friendship or love depending
upon superiority, the friendship or love of a father for
a son, of a husband for a wife, of a ruler for a subject.
These friendships are of different sorts: the love of a
husband for a wife is not the same as that of wife for
a husband. There is a different virtue in each, a different
function, and different motives. It follows that the
services rendered by each party to the other are not
the same, nor is it right to expect they should be.
In all such friendships as depend upon the principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
superiority, the affection should be proportionate to
the superiority; <i>i.e.</i>, the better or the more useful
party, or whoever may be the superior, should receive
more affection than he gives.</p>

</div>

<p>This may sound to us humorous, but Aristotle is
quite serious: it is part of his great doctrine of
‘proportional equality’; and his only doubt is as
to which adjective is most appropriate to man,
‘better,’ or ‘more useful,’ or simply ‘superior.’<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Friendship leads to a discussion of domestic associations,
and while the <em>rule</em> of a slave-master seems a
<em>right</em> form of despotism, the association of husband
and wife is judged to be ‘aristocratical,’ for the
husband’s rule depends upon merit and is confined
to its proper sphere. He assigns to the wife all that
suitably belongs to her. If the husband is lord of
<em>everything</em>, he changes the association to an ‘oligarchy’;
for then he acts unfairly and not in virtue
of his superior merit. ‘Sometimes the wife rules
as being an heiress, but such rule is not based upon
merit.’<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Last comes the question of children; and here, at
least, we need make no criticisms:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is evident why mothers love their children more
than fathers. The procreation of children is the universal
function of animals. In the case of other animals,
this is the limit of their association; but men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
women unite not only for the procreation of children
but for the purposes of life. As soon as they unite,
a distribution of functions takes place. Some are proper
to the husband and others to the wife; hence
they supply one another’s needs, each contributing
to the common stock. Utility and pleasure seem alike
to be found in the marriage relationship, but its basis
will be virtue, too. Children are a bond of union, and
such marriages as are childless are dissolved with
comparatively little difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The <cite>Politics</cite> begin with a discussion of slavery,
and, by an association of ideas natural in Greek
society, for Aristotle never attempts to rise above
the conditions of life about him, slaves and women
are treated together:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He who can foresee with his mind is by nature intended
to be lord and master; and he who can work
with his body is a subject, and by nature a slave:
hence, master and slave have the same interest.
Nature, however, has distinguished between the female
and the slave. For she is not niggardly; she makes
each thing for a single use, and every instrument is
best made when intended for one and not for many
uses. But among barbarians no distinction is made
between women and slaves.</p>

</div>

<p>It should be noticed here that the essential quality
of the master is not physical strength, but mental
capacity; it is the mind and not the body that makes
the ‘natural’ slave, the ‘live tool,’ as Aristotle
defines him. Man and woman, master and slave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
these are the foundations of the family. As Hesiod
says: ‘First a house, then a woman, and then an
ox for the plough’; and Aristotle has no difficulty
in finding the arrangement right. He puts the
question:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Is there any one intended by nature to be a slave, so
that for him the condition of slavery is expedient and
right; or, rather, is not all slavery a violation of
nature?</p>

</div>

<p>And gives the immediate reply:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There is no difficulty in answering this question on
grounds both of reason and of fact. For that some
should rule and others be ruled is a thing not only
necessary but expedient; from the hour of their birth
some are marked out for subjection, others for rule.</p>

</div>

<p>The law, he thinks, holds through all nature:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Tame animals have a better nature than wild, and
all tame animals are better off when they are ruled by
men, for then they are preserved. The male is by nature
superior, and the female inferior; and the one rules and
the other is ruled; this principle of necessity extends
to all mankind. Nature would like to distinguish
between the bodies of freemen and slaves; but this
does not hold universally.</p>

</div>

<p>So the string of assertions goes on, and the discussion
closes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is clear, <em>therefore</em>, that some men are by nature
free and others slaves, and that for these latter slavery
is both expedient and right.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Having thus justified slavery to his own satisfaction,
Aristotle proceeds to deal with household
management, which he subdivides into three parts:
the rule of a master over slaves, of a father, and of
a husband:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A husband and a father rules over wife and children,
both free, but the rule differs: over his children it is
a royal, over his wife a constitutional rule. For,
although there may be exceptions to the order of nature,
the male is by nature fitter for command than the female,
just as the elder and full-grown is superior to the
younger and more immature.</p>

</div>

<p>To illustrate his point, Aristotle quotes the saying
of Amasis and his foot-pan, a good story, although
it does not exactly strengthen the philosopher’s
position. Amasis was a commoner, who became
King of Egypt; to prove to his subjects the essential
equality of all matter, he had his metal bath melted
down and re-cast as a statue, to which all the people
made humble obeisance, although they had treated
the foot-pan with contempt. Then Amasis drew
his moral: the substance of both bath and statue
is the same; there is merely a difference in outward
form. ‘Of this kind,’ says Aristotle, ‘is the relation
between male and female; but there <em>the inequality
is permanent</em>.’</p>

<p>It is the business of household management to
ensure excellence, and we are faced at once by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
difficulty: can a slave possess virtue? If he has
virtue, in what will he differ from a freeman? A
similar question may be raised about women and
children: ought a woman to be called temperate,
brave, and just? Aristotle solves the difficulty
thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Women and slaves have a sort of virtue, the virtue
of the irrational part of the soul. The slave has no
deliberate faculty at all; the woman has it, but with her
it is inconclusive. The ruler must have moral virtue
in perfection; the subject requires only that measure
of virtue which is proper to him. Virtue will be common
to man and woman, but it will not be the same
virtue: <i>e.g.</i>, the courage of a man is shown in commanding,
of a woman in obeying.</p>

</div>

<p>These are hard sayings, and they bring Aristotle into
direct conflict with Plato, who, in the <cite>Meno</cite>, discusses
the question whether the virtue of a man and a woman
is the same or different, and comes to the conclusion
that it is the same. But Aristotle never hesitates
to criticise his former teacher, and it is a curious
point how far his low estimate of women is not the
result of the pupil’s unconscious reaction against
a master’s enthusiasm. A great part of the <cite>Politics</cite>
is, in fact, a criticism of the <cite>Republic</cite>, and the discussion
on slavery, which occupies most of the first
book, is followed by a close consideration of Plato’s
communistic State. The objections raised are of
a severely practical nature, <i>e.g.</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If the women are shared in common, and private
property is retained, the men will see to the fields;
but who will see to the house?</p>

</div>

<p>And again:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Two virtues are destroyed in the communistic State;
first, temperance towards women (for it is an honourable
action to abstain from another man’s wife for temperance’
sake); secondly, liberality in the matter of property.
The legislation of such a State may have a
specious appearance of benevolence, but such evils as
there are in property are due to a cause that laws
cannot eradicate: the wickedness of human nature.
Indeed, we see that there is much more quarrelling
among those who have all things in common, though
there are not many of them, than there is among the
vast majority of men who keep to private property.</p>

</div>

<p>The criticism, however, although acute on points
of detail, does not touch the essentials of feminism,
and, in the <cite>Politics</cite>, Aristotle often reveals himself
unconsciously as Plato’s former disciple. His remarks
on education are based very largely, although
he makes no acknowledgment, on his master’s
teaching and scarcely harmonise with his own
views on women. The concluding sentences of the
first book, for example, are distinctly Platonic in
their tone:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The relations of husband and wife, parent and child,
their several virtues, what in their intercourse with
one another is good and what is evil, and how we may
pursue the good and escape the evil, will have to be
discussed when we speak of the different forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
government. For inasmuch as every family is a part
of a State, and these relationships are the parts of a
family, the virtue of the part must have regard to the
virtue of the whole. And therefore women and children
must be trained by education with an eye to the
State, if the virtues of either of them are supposed to
make any difference in the virtues of the State. And
they must make a difference; for the children grow up
to be citizens, and half the free persons in a State are
women.</p>

</div>

<p>So in discussing the Spartan constitution he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A husband and a wife being each a part of every
family, the State may be considered as about equally
divided into men and women: and, therefore, in those
States where the condition of the women is bad, half
the city may be regarded as having no laws<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>—</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">a sentiment taken, with a slight difference of application,
directly from Plato himself, and the Platonic
influence is plainly seen in all the chapters which
treat of marriage and education:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Since the legislator should begin by considering how
the frames of the children whom he is rearing may be
as good as possible, his first care will be about marriage,
at what age should his citizens marry, and who are
fit to marry.</p>

</div>

<p>So the discussion starts reasonably enough, but the
conclusion hardly agrees with modern ideas of
eugenics:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Women should marry when they are about eighteen
years of age, and men at seven-and-thirty; then they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
are in the prime of life, and the decline in the powers
of both will coincide. Furthermore, the children, if
their birth takes place at the time that may reasonably
be expected, will succeed in their prime, when the
fathers are already in the decline of life and have
nearly reached their term of three-scores years and
ten.</p>

</div>

<p>Aristotle here seems to be following not any ideal
system, but the actual practice of his time, a practice
which Euripides (fr. 319) had already condemned.
The gap in age between husband and wife is far too
great for any real physical or moral companionship.
The husband, moreover, remaining unmarried until
the age of thirty-seven, can hardly be supposed to
have escaped from the illicit connections which were
allowed and encouraged by Athenian custom:
to say that such an one is in his prime is surely to
mis-state the case. The art of being a grandfather
also under this system tends to disappear, for a man
could hardly hope to see grandchildren of his own,
if neither he nor his sons married till they were
thirty-seven: his daughters, of course, as Euripides
again tells us (fr. 320), on marriage passed altogether
out of their father’s life. The whole arrangement is
obviously wrong, but it suited the conditions of
Athenian domestic life, where a young wife could
be more easily kept in subjection and large families
were neither desired nor customary; and because
it existed, therefore to Aristotle it seemed right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The female, found to be inferior in a moral and
political sense, is also considered by Aristotle to be
physically inferior to the male, and in the treatise
<cite>On Generation</cite> he deals with this question frequently
and at some length:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Male and female differ in their essence by each having
a separate ability or faculty, and anatomically by
certain parts; essentially the male is that which is
able to generate in another, the female is that which
is able to generate in itself and out of which comes into
being the offspring previously existing in the parent.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The distinction of sex is a first principle:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>An animal is not male or female in virtue of an isolated
part or an isolated faculty: when that which distinguishes
male and female suffers change many other
changes accompany it, as would be the case if a first
principle is changed.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The treatise is concerned chiefly with the
phenomena of reproduction:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>For the business of most animals is, you may say,
nothing else than to produce young, as the business of
a plant is to produce seed and fruit.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sex-characteristics accordingly are described
mainly in accordance with their reproductive functions.</p>

<p>As regards the origin of sex and the causes of male<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and female, Aristotle is a curious mixture of prejudice
and insight. He begins thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To suppose that heat and cold are the causes of male
and female, or that the different sexes come from the
right and left, is not altogether unreasonable in itself,
for the right of the body is hotter than the left.</p>

</div>

<p>With him it is an unquestioning belief that the right
is, in nature, superior to the left, the upper to the
lower, the front to the back; and nature, when no
more important purpose stands in the way, places
the more honourable part in the more honourable
position. So it is that the heart, which is the nobler
organ, is in the upper part of the body, while the
stomach is in the lower. As he is equally sure that
the male is superior to the female, the male elements
in reproduction will come from the right or noble
part of the body.</p>

<p>But the part taken by the male and female elements
in the process of generation is, according to
Aristotle, absolutely different. The child is not
formed from a mixture of both, but the female contributes
the material, the male is the active agent.
The analogy used is that of a bed: the female is the
wood, the male the carpenter, who, from the wood,
makes the bed. The female is passive, the male is
active:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is through a certain incapacity that the female is
female: females are weaker and colder in nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
than males, and we must look upon the female character
as being a sort of natural deficiency.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Women, in Aristotle’s view, are rather plants
than animals; for the animal differs from the plant,
chiefly in having sense-perception. If the sensitive
soul is not present, the body is no better than a
corpse, and this sensitive soul is supplied only by
the male. The female provides the material, the
male fashions it; the body is from the female, the
soul from the male, who can stand outside the body
just as the artist stands outside his creation. It
certainly seems that female children progress more
quickly than male, but that is merely a proof of
their inferiority; for all inferior things come sooner
to their perfection or end, and as this is true of
works of art so it is true of what is formed by
nature.</p>

<p>These quotations will illustrate that curious
depreciation of the female element in nature and
especially in man which is one of the weaker points
in the treatise. It is continually recurring; for
example, in describing the hair of animals these are
the reasons given for baldness:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The front part of the head goes bald because the
brain is there and man is the only animal to go bald,
because his brain is much the largest and moistest.
<em>Women do not go bald.</em><a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>So in the discussion of voice we read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The voice of the female is higher than that of the male
in all animals, and in man this is especially noticeable.
A deep note is <em>better</em> than a high pitched: depth belongs
to the nobler nature, and depth of tone shows a sort
of superiority.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nor is this view of the physical, and consequently
the mental, inferiority of the female confined to the
<cite>De Generatione</cite>: it permeates the <cite>History of Animals</cite>,
and finds its clearest expression there in a passage
which perhaps gives the ultimate reason of Aristotle’s
error:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In all genera in which the distinction of male and
female is found, Nature makes a similar differentiation
in the mental characteristics of the two sexes. This
differentiation is the most obvious in the case
of human-kind and in that of the larger animals
and the viviparous quadrupeds. In the case of
these latter the female is softer in character,
is the sooner tamed, admits more readily of
caressing, and is more apt in the way of learning.
With all animals, except the bear and the leopard,
the female is softer in disposition than the male, is
more mischievous, less simple, more impulsive, and
more attentive to the nurture of the young. The
traces of these differentiated characteristics are more
or less visible in every species, but they are especially
visible where character is the more developed, and
most of all in man. The fact is, the nature of man is
the most rounded off and complete, and consequently
in man the qualities above referred to are found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
their perfection. Hence woman is more compassionate
than man, more easily moved to tears, at the same time
is more jealous, more querulous, more apt to scold.
She is, furthermore, more prone to despondency and
less hopeful than the man, more void of shame or
self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive,
and of more retentive memory. She is also more
wakeful, more shrinking, more difficult to rouse to
action, and requires a smaller quantity of nutriment.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Athenian women of the fourth century were
the women that Aristotle knew best, and, given
Aristotle’s character and scientific method, it is not
surprising that he should judge Woman in the
abstract to be an inferior animal. If he had been a
little more of a poet and idealist—in other words,
if he had not been Aristotle—he might have taken
another view; but considering the facts of Athenian
life in his day, and Aristotle’s disposition to cling
to facts, we need not wonder at his estimate. The
real mischief—and Aristotle’s influence in this matter
has been an enormous hindrance to human progress—was
done not by the philosopher himself, for in
his time the position of women could hardly have been
altered for the worse, but by his blind followers in
later ages when his slightest word was regarded
almost as inspired truth. Aristotle himself is
never dogmatic (he leaves that to weaker men),
and does not profess to give anything but the somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
casual expression of his own personal knowledge
and opinions.</p>

<p>It is hardly right to blame him: women in his
time undoubtedly were the inferior sex, and Aristotle
is always the prophet of things as they are. The
<i lang="fr">protégé</i> of the absolute monarchy which had overthrown
the city-states, he has no belief in abstract
freedom or in social reform. For him, what is is
right. ‘Women and slaves are inferior,’ he says
to himself, ‘by the conditions of existence as I see
them: <em>therefore</em> they are inferior by the laws of
nature,’ and although he knows that this inferiority
was the result of the conditions of their life, his
business is only with facts.</p>

<p>But he generalises from insufficient data: Woman
for him means the women of his time, and although
he points out the influence of environment, he fails
to distinguish between innate and accidental characteristics.
And so again, in treating of the female
sex in nature, he is too inclined to confine himself
to the higher mammals. He emphasises the case
of the herbivorous animals, those that go in herds,
and are polygamous in their habits: deer, for
example, where the male has a distinct advantage
in size and strength; while he says little of the carnivora,
who hunt in pairs and are monogamous, where
the female tends to be equal in every respect to the
male. Insects he almost disregards, and the microscope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
in the hands of a naturalist of genius like
M. Fabre, has opened up for us a world from which
Aristotle was debarred by the material limitations
of his instruments.</p>

<p>We see now that Nature, at least, has no favoured
sex, and that Euripides’ words are as true in a
zoological as they are in a sociological sense: ‘All
that can be said of the male can be said equally well
of the female, and <i lang="la">vice versa</i>.’ The male that in
some species is the stronger and more active, in
others is the weaker and plays a passive rôle. The
female mantis that devours her feeble mate is the
reverse side of Nature’s picture. So again, all the
fascinating problems of parthenogenesis, whereby
the female may produce for several births without
the intervention of the male, have received a new
light from the close study of the hive. Aristotle’s
chapter on bees suffers materially from lack of
first-hand knowledge, and, as Professor Platt says,
although it is greatly to his credit for hard thinking,
it reveals the fact that he knew next to nothing
about the subject. Of course, the whole method
of bee-generation is totally at variance with
Aristotle’s theory of male superiority, and if he
had possessed our knowledge his theory might have
been modified. In the world of insects, at least,
feminism reigns; the male is weak and subservient,
the female is the ruler. Often the male is an accident;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the female would have sufficed. So true is this that
a modern essayist, M. Remy de Gourmont, writing
under the influence of Fabre’s discoveries, can vary
Aristotle’s analogy and compare the female to the
clock and the male to the necessary key that winds
up the mechanism.</p>

<p>But although Aristotle can scarcely be said to
understand all the mysteries of sex, he anticipates
some of the most fruitful investigations of modern
research, and in all questions of pure science, within
the limits of his own experience, he is almost infallible.
It is unfortunate that his experience of
women was misleading, and that the problems of
feminism do not always fall within the confines
of science. That he was wrong in this matter is
chiefly the fault of his times and their social conditions,
and those who live in other days and amid
other surroundings should remember his own significant
words, spoken indeed about bees, but equally
applicable to other social animals:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Such appears to me to be the truth, judging from
theory and what I believe to be the facts. But up to
the present the facts have not been sufficiently comprehended;
if ever they are, then credit must be
given to observation rather than to theories, and to
theories only if what they affirm agrees with observed
facts.</p>

</div>

<p>And with that quotation we may well leave him:
<i lang="la">Amicus Aristoteles; magis amica veritas</i>. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
facts of modern existence show women to be the
inferior sex, then, and then only, are we moderns
justified in holding that opinion. But every man
should judge for himself on the evidence that his
own observation gives, and not be influenced by the
theories of other men or by the literature of the past.</p>

<p>In Aristotle’s time, for reasons which this brief
survey of Greek literature has, perhaps, made plain,
the facts of women’s nature were certainly not
sufficiently comprehended. Euripides and Plato
are almost the only authors who show any true
appreciation of a woman’s real qualities, and to
Euripides and Plato, Aristotle, by the whole trend
of his prejudices, was opposed. His mistake was
that he failed to realise the moral aspects of feminism.
A nation that degrades its women will inevitably
suffer degradation itself. Aristotle lent the weight
of his name to a profound error, and helped to perpetuate
the malady which had already been the chief
cause of the destruction of Greece.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
